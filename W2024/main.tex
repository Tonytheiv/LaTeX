    \item Release of inhibitory neurotransmitter by presynaptic neuron directly inhibits depolarization of postsynaptic neuron
    \item Triggers influx of negatively charged ions (usually ${\rm Cl^-}$) or efflux of positive ions (usually ${\rm K^+}$) and hyperpolarizes postsynaptic neuron  (this dampens a neuron's ability to fire)
    \item May be a single signal (hyperpolarization) or a combined signal(hyper + depol) from multiple synapses in cell body of postsynaptic neuron
    \item Inhibitory neuron synapse at \textbf{axon terminal} of presynaptic neuron indirectly inhibits depolarization of postsynaptic neuron
    \item Inhibitory neuron sends signal and releases neurotransmitters
    \item Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on presynaptic synapse and closes calcium channels (Limits neurotransmitters released from excitatory neuron, so not as many channels open on postsynaptic neuron)
    \item \textbf{Function:} modulates synaptic strength, allows for filtering of sensory information, regulation of neural circuits, prevels excessive excitation leading to neuron damage

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Skeletal \& cardiac muscle highly organized
        \item Contractile protein (actin \& myosin) organization in
muscle fibers creates striation
        \item Organization allows for precise control \& powerful
contractions
    \end{itemize}
    \item Smooth muscle has less orderly arrangement and
so no striation

\subsection{Neuromuscular Junction}
\begin{remark}
    Motor neurons innervate skeletal muscle cells
\end{remark}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{Pictures/Screenshot 2024-04-03 005847.png}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Action potential arrives at presynaptic terminal
    \item Voltage gated calcium channels open, allowing influx of calcium cations
    \item Calcium cations allows vesicle docking at acteylcholine (ACh) release
    \item Channels open when 2 ACh bind to each receptor
    \item End-plate potential is generated
    \item Action potential is generated and spreads to muscle fibre
    \item Neurotransmitter is removed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Skeletal Muscle Function (Excitation-Contraction Coupling)}
At the neuromuscular Junction and EPP, the action potential get to a core myofibril in muscle fibre cell 

\subsubsection{Excitation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ach release at neuromuscular junction
    \item AP spreads across
entire sarcolemma and
into T-tubules
    \item Calcium cations release by SR into
cytoplasm (sarcoplasm)
    \item Calcium cations binds to
tropomyosin complex
\& causes active sites on
actin filaments to be
exposed
    \item Myosin binds to actin \&
initiates cross bridging
process (muscle
contraction)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Pictures/Screenshot 2024-04-03 223557.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Cross-bridge cycle}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item binding
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ATP hydrolysius to ADP
        \item Energized myosin head
        \item Myosin attaches to actin forming cross bridge
    \end{itemize}
    \item bending
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Power stroke
        \item Myosin-actin binding triggers release of stored energy
        \item Myosin pivots (ADP \& Pi released)
        \item Pulls actin to center of sarcomere
    \end{itemize}
    \item detachment
    \begin{itemize}
        \item New ATP binds to myosin
head
        \item Decreases affinity of myosin
for actin
        \item Myosin detaches from actin
filament
    \end{itemize}
    \item energized
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Myosin returned to original
position
        \item ATP hydrolized to ADP \& Pi
        \item Myosin re-energized and
prepares for another binding
cycle
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{Pictures/Screenshot 2024-04-03 223633.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Relaxation}
\begin{enumerate}[start=6]
    \item ACh is broken down by
acetylcholinesterase
    \item SR uses ATP-powered pumps
to collect Calcium cations
    \item Tropomyosin complex takes
up myosin binding sites
    \item Cross-bridge binding does not
occur. Compressed Titin recoils
the sarcomere, like a spring
    \item Muscle relaxation occurs
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Sympathetic
Nervous System}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sympathetic nerves releases NE and
cardiomyocytes have $\beta1$ adrenergic receptors.
Recall that agonism of $\beta1$ receptors leads to
excitation of target cells
    \item Conduction velocity increases for the AV node and purkinje fibres, because in the sympathetic $\uparrow=$ $\uparrow$ calcium cations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Autonomic Tone}
There is always the influence of the parasympathetic
and sympathetic nervous systems. That is to say, the
systems do not behave as an “on/off” but rather
“more/less”

\end{figure}

\textbf{Calcium cation permeability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calcium current: movement of
calcium ions through a cell’s
membrane (recall skeletal
muscle mechanics)
    \item Sympathetic stimulation (i.e., Norepinephrine but
also Epinephrine) enhances Cacium currents and
availability of Calcium cation in the cytosol (cytoplasm) of
ventricular myocytes. These two factors increases the
force developed by ventricular myocytes and the
force of ventricular contraction

        \item Metropolis: 1920s: Factory work
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Machinery and technology has big role in peoples' lives
            \item Automation, people being replaced
            \item Huge divide between upper and lower class (hierarchy, temptation within lower class), seen visually as well in film with visual divisions
            \item Relationship between machines and bodies become central. Notice that machines are named after body parts e.g. heart machine
        \end{itemize} 
        \item Maria and Maria-tron
        \begin{itemize}

    \begin{remark}
        Interesting that the mediator is also part of the highest class, how you need to have the luxury in the first place to be able to mediate. There must be a heart connecting the head and the hands: the system and class necessary? 
    \end{remark}
    \begin{remark}
        Images of wonder in Metropolis also influenced fantasy cinema, like cartoons and anime. Where else do we see similar pictures?
    \end{remark}
    \begin{remark}
        Metropolis revolutionized film not because of inventing particular techniques, it's about fusing everything together at the same time. I.e. all the special effects.
    \end{remark}
    \begin{remark}
        Choreography difference between portraying the workers at the beginning, robotic movements, not human-like vs. portraying the maria-tron dancing humanly, gracefully in the performance. Note that the power treats workers (humans) like machines, and machines (maria-tron) like a human (Facist Automation?).
    \end{remark}
    \begin{remark}
        In many ways an anti-capitalistic critique. Politics-wised, very socialist. Combining the people in one body. A lot of montages played with at the beginning of the film. Protagonist as saint, antagonist as un-saint: negative portrayal of working class (i.e. the workers breaking the heart machine). Nothing really unites the two classes, like in fascism, they are joined together by blaming the outside (ie. Germans blaming the Jew). The joint doesn't lead to any real solution and in the end nothing is really changed.

\begin{exercise}
    What is included in mise-en-scene? What is excluded?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Included:} Mise-en-scène encompasses elements such as setting, lighting, costume, makeup, staging, and the positioning of characters and props within the frame. It also includes the use of colors, textures, and overall visual composition.}
        \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Excluded:} Mise-en-scène typically does not involve camera movement, editing, or sound. These elements are often considered separately as part of cinematography and editing.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    What is German Expressionism? What is an example of German expressionism in one of the films we studied?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Definition:} German Expressionism is an artistic movement that emerged in Germany during the early 20th century, characterized by distorted perspectives, chiaroscuro lighting, angular shapes, and a general emphasis on expressing emotional and psychological states over realistic representation.}
        \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Example in Film:} \textit{The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari} (1920) directed by Robert Wiene is a classic example of German Expressionist cinema.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    What is a \enquote{fascist automation}?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Definition:} A "fascist automaton" refers to a representation of a machine or robot in the context of a fascist ideology. It often symbolizes control, conformity, and the dehumanization of individuals within a totalitarian regime.}
        \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    What is an \enquote{image of wonder}?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Definition:} An "image of wonder" refers to a visual or cinematic element that evokes a sense of awe, amazement, or astonishment. It is often associated with breathtaking visuals or extraordinary events that captivate the audience.}
        \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Name at least three special effects in \textit{Metropolis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Miniature models of the cityscape.}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Stop-motion animation for certain scenes.}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Back projection techniques for combining live-action with pre-filmed backgrounds.}
        \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Give one reason that the machine is conceptually based on the feminine.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Reason:} The machine in \textit{Metropolis} is conceptually based on the feminine because it represents a fusion of technology and biology. The machine, particularly the Maria-like android, embodies both mechanical and human characteristics, blurring the lines between the artificial and the organic.}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Exploration of Gender Roles:} The decision to craft the machine in a female likeness allows the film to explore and challenge traditional gender roles. It brings attention to societal expectations and the intersection of technology with gender dynamics, reflecting the anxieties and aspirations of the era in which the film was produced.}
        \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
    Give one reason for biblical iconography in metropolis.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Reason:} One reason for biblical iconography in \textit{Metropolis} is the film's exploration of themes related to class struggle and social inequality. The biblical references, such as the Tower of Babel, are used to underscore the hubris of the upper class and the consequences of their exploitation of the lower class.}
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{The social functions of genre}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reaffirm cultural values in a predictable way (In Godzilla, the fisherman talk about how breaking culture and tradition is taboo and can cause harm)
        \item Exploit ambivalent social values and attitudes (In Godzilla, it reaffirms social order by purging threatening elements from within society, equivocate on the inherent morality of a society governed by scientific rationality, monster as a symbol for the atomic bombs)
        \item Respond to social trends
        \item Reflect pervasive doubts and anxieties
        \item A deliberate effort to treat a social issue (In Godzilla, we address the bombs dropped in Japan and the threat of nuclear warfare)

        \item These disasters added to intensive bombing upon other Japanese cities during the
war and effects of natural disasters
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Susan Sontag:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \enquote{Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is
one of the oldest subjects of art. In science fiction films disaster is rarely
viewed intensively; it is always extensive. It is a matter of quantity and
ingenuity. If you will, it is a question of scale. But the scale … does raise the
matter to another level}
        \item \enquote{The aesthetics of destruction, with the particular beauties to be found in
wreaking havoc [are] the core of good science fiction film}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{remark}
        Why do images of mass destruction (esp. in globally-
recognized cities) give us visual pleasure in the cinema?
    \end{remark}
    \item \textbf{Science as \enquote{Pharmakon}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A Greek word that can be translated as remedy, poison, and scapegoat
        \item A both-and concept developed by French philosopher Jacques Derrida (he originally uses it to describe writing)
        \item Yoav Rinon: \enquote{It is both a remedy, as the city's existence in a time of crisis, especially in time of plague,
depends on it; and a poison, since that kind of existence is an outcome of the scapegoat's
expulsion and, sometimes, death.}
        \item Consider: How does the disaster film treat science or tech as an all-of-the-above remedy,
poison, and scapegoat for social ills?
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Godzilla is...}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The bomb
        \item The victim
        \item Survivor
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shot distances}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item longer shots show destruction
        \item shorter and closer shots show emotion
        \item note there was a fair distribution of all shots in Godzilla, two separate stories going on, the front end disaster and the back end love triangle
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Film sounds}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Diegetic (within context of story, can be heard by characters) vs. non-diegetic
        \item Synchronic vs. non-synchronic
        \item Internal (ie. inside someone's head) vs. external 
        \item Acousmatic (visual source cannot be seen, ie. voice from a radio) vs. visualized (can see source)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
    Often in scifi scientists are antagonized (science can be exploited), here Godzilla provides an interesting perspective, how there is sympathy, the creator of the oxygen destroyer, similar to Oppenheimer being the destroyer or worlds. Science is "pharmacon", both poison and remedy. Note image of scientist changes. Important: film not written by the victors, political relevance?

\subsection*{"The Imagination of Disaster" by Susan Sontag}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Structure of Science Fiction Films:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sontag notes that typical science fiction films follow predictable patterns, much like westerns. She outlines a model scenario with five phases.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Model Scenario:}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item The arrival of a threatening entity or force, witnessed by a young scientist who struggles to convince others.
        \item Confirmation of the threat with destructive acts. Attempts at peaceful resolution fail, leading to mass casualties.
        \item National and international response to the crisis, with conferences between scientists and the military. Plans for destroying the enemy are made.
        \item Escalation of atrocities, unsuccessful counter-attacks, and a final strategy involving a powerful weapon. The enemy is repulsed.
        \item Concluding scenes with mutual congratulations, as the hero and his girlfriend wonder if the threat is truly over.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Variations in Scripts:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sontag describes a simpler, lower-budget script with four phases, often involving a hero facing a threat alone and discovering the enemy's vulnerability.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Different Themes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Various scenarios involve monstrous transformations caused by scientific experiments, nuclear testing leading to global catastrophe, or space exploration revealing threats to other planets.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Aesthetics of Destruction:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sontag argues that science fiction films are not primarily about science but about disaster. She emphasizes the aesthetic appeal of destruction, with a focus on quantity, ingenuity, and scale.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Imagery and Sensuous Elaboration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Science fiction films use images and sounds to allow viewers to experience the fantasy of catastrophic events. The emphasis is on sensuous elaboration, creating a visual and auditory spectacle.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Importance of Budget and Technology:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sontag mentions the importance of budget and technology in creating visually compelling science fiction films. Widescreen color films, with well-designed model environments, contribute to the genre's impact.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Aesthetics of Destruction:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The core of a good science fiction film, according to Sontag, lies in the imagery of destruction. The essay suggests that the aesthetics of wreaking havoc and making a mess are central to the genre.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primitive Gratifications and Shared Themes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Certain primitive gratifications in science fiction films, such as depicting urban disaster on a magnified scale, are shared with other film genres. The depiction of mass havoc in old horror and monster films is visually similar to science fiction films, with the difference being primarily in scale.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Similarity with Old Monster Films:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sontag draws parallels between the destruction scenes in old monster films, such as King Kong (1933), and those in science fiction films of the 1950s. The archetype of monsters wreaking havoc in a great city remains consistent, with destruction scenes in various science fiction films mentioned.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Familiar Themes and Grimness in 1950s Science Fiction Films:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Science fiction films of the 1950s take up familiar themes found in 1930s movie serials, comics, and superhero stories. However, Sontag notes a distinct grimness in modern science fiction films, possibly influenced by the enlarged imagination of disaster in contemporary reality.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Fantasy of Disaster and Moral Simplification:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The lure of fantasizing about disaster lies in its release from normal obligations. End-of-the-world movies, such as "The Day the Earth Caught Fire" (1962), present scenes of deserted metropolises, offering a fantasy of starting anew. Science fiction films also provide extreme moral simplification, allowing the audience to explore cruel or amoral feelings.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Moralistic and Aesthetic View of Destruction:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Science fiction films are strongly moralistic, often conveying messages about the proper use of science. The films offer a dispassionate, aesthetic view of destruction and violence, emphasizing a technological perspective. Objects and machinery play a major role, embodying a greater range of ethical values than the characters.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Scientific Enterprise and Morality:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The scientist in science fiction films is often depicted as morally ambivalent, with an emphasis on the proper and humane use of science versus the mad or obsessional use of science. This moralistic theme is shared with classic horror films of the 1930s, such as "Frankenstein" and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Ambivalence Toward Scientists:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Scientists in science fiction films are susceptible to cracking up or going off the deep end. Ambivalence toward scientists is evident, and even sympathetic treatment is conditional on the utility of their scientific endeavors. Intellectual curiosity is often portrayed as a maniacal dementia, cutting scientists off from normal human relations.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Contemporary Mistrust of the Intellect:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is a contemporary mistrust of the intellect in science fiction films, particularly directed at the scientist-as-intellectual. The scientist who releases uncontrollable forces is portrayed as a potential threat, and the creative scientist may become a martyr to his own discovery.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Changed Proportions in Attitudes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sontag notes a change in proportions regarding attitudes toward scientists in contemporary science fiction films. While scientists are still treated as both satanists and saviors, the context has shifted, and the scientist's sphere of influence is no longer local but planetary and cosmic.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Nuclear Trauma and Exorcism:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Many science fiction films, particularly in Japanese cinema, reflect a collective trauma related to nuclear weapons and the fear of future nuclear wars.
    \item The awakening of super-destructive monsters often serves as a metaphor for the atomic bomb, with explicit references to nuclear warfare and its consequences.
    \item Themes of contamination, destruction, and global catastrophe permeate narratives, attempting to exorcise the anxieties surrounding nuclear technologies.
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Radiation and Casualties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Radiation casualties and the concept of the world as a casualty of nuclear testing are central to science fiction film narratives.
    \item Universes become expendable, worlds become contaminated, burnt out, and obsolete, reflecting deep anxieties about the consequences of nuclear technology.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Wishful Thinking and Imagery of War:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Science fiction films often feature wishful thinking, including a desire for a "good war" devoid of moral problems.
    \item Imagery of war, including dogfights and escalating firepower, satisfies both bellicose and pacifistic desires, projecting a fantasy of united warfare and international cooperation.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Dehumanization and Anxiety:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Themes of dehumanization, symbolized by alien invaders seeking to take over humanity, reflect anxieties about the impersonal and depersonalizing conditions of modern urban life.
    \item The fear of losing individuality to a mechanized, emotionless existence is a recurring motif in science fiction films, portraying a struggle against the erasure of humanity.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Fantasy as Coping Mechanism:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Science fiction films, serving as a popular mythology, allow individuals to cope with the anxieties of banality and inconceivable terror through fantasy.
    \item The films normalize psychologically unbearable scenarios, providing a temporary escape while also inuring audiences to the depicted terrors.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Complicity with the Abhorrent:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Science fiction films, inadvertently or not, are in complicity with the abhorrent by neutralizing and making unthinkable scenarios more palatable.
    \item The films perpetuate clichés about identity, power, knowledge, and guilt, raising moral questions about the act of "thinking about the unthinkable" in a fantastical context.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Future}
\subsection{La Jetee}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primal Scene:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freudian term
        \item The sight or fantasy of the sight of one's parents having sex
        \item It addresses the question: "where do I come from?"
        \item \textit{Terminator} series exploits this
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Terminator (evil machine from dystopian future) sent back in time to kill
the mother (Sarah Connor) of the leader of the human resistance to the
terminators
            \item Member of the human resistance (Kyle Reese) also sent back to protect
Sarah
            \item  Sarah and Kyle sleep together and conceive John Connor (future leader of
resistance)
            \item  In the future, John selects Kyle to be his father and sends Kyle back to
conceive him with his mother Sarah
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Director: \textbf{Chris Maker}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Important member of the French New Wave cinema (Left Bank)
        \item Essay films (like La Jetee)
        \item Travel and powerful voiceovers
        \item Famously reclusive and elusive
        \item Often represented in the press by images of his cat
    \end{itemize}
    \item Vertical Orientation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Underground (where experiment takes place) vs. in the sky (planes)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Holocaust-like imagery}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reference to WWII: the scientist speaking German
        \item Scientist represent facism. Ambition to go to the future associated with facism. 
        \item Scientists fixated to going to the future to fix things vs. thinking about what they did wrong in the past. Going to the future means that they will just keep doing what they're doing and hoping it works instead of learning.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spectatorship}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Male spectators \& woman stars
        \item The spectated and the spectator both in the same frame
        \item "freezing effect" of everything, memories. Film creates, film destroys
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Still vs. Movement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The woman: the only one who is both the still and the moving (blinking scene)
        \item Waking up from death? Many ways to interpret this
    \end{itemize}
    \item Heavy use of \textbf{acousmatic sound}: makes it feel like both a silent and a sound film
    \item \textbf{The museum scene}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The animals in the museum: "eternal animals"
        \item One of the shots make the man and the woman makes it seem like they are in the glass cage as well: animals more alive than humans, animals looking at humans in a museum? Good mise-en-scene
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
    The medium of film allows for easy time travel. The still images create a better representation of what memory is like. At its base, film is still images. Movement is an illusion. La Jetee shows us what film really is at its DNA by breaking it down into stills (like a storyboard). It seems like we are getting less, but it is forcing us to consciously fill in the gaps (vs unconsciously, conventionally) and getting more out of it. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Due to the use of still images, sound is more important than usual. Sound creates emotions. Sound is more cinematic than the picture in this picture because sound has to be continuous, it cannot be broken into stills. The images have our senses overturn: letting us see the world in a different way: self reflective? 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Trying to go into the future in one way the scientist want to do to make whole what is broken, which is not how it should be done. Question: what can film do to repair the future
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Relatable way of storytelling: the still images are similar to how we remember things, we associate memories with photographs normally and not necessary moving pictures
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Wanting to time-travel to future: the belief of the future as something better, a utopia 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Not your typical blockbuster film: takes a different approach of documenting disater without the use of special effect
\end{remark}
\begin{exercise}
Chris Marker's experimental film La Jetée famously uses science fiction to reflect on the nature of cinema. What is one aspect of the film that you believe makes a claim about what film is or how it feels? This could be anything from an image to the filming style to part of the voiceover.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Possible Answers: The use of still images suggests that memory and cinema share a fundamental structure; the disjointed visual style mirrors how we recall events; the focus on a single image emphasizes the power of a frozen moment in creating emotion and narrative.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is a primal scene? How does the death in the film relate?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{A primal scene is a foundational moment in Freudian psychoanalysis, often referring to a child witnessing their parents during sexual intercourse. The witnessed death on the airport jetty leaves a traumatic imprint on the protagonist, becoming a recurring image that haunts his memories and shapes his perception of time.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is the main reason that Marker shoots with almost all stills?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Marker primarily uses still images to evoke the nature of memory and its relationship to the cinematic experience. Memories often exist in our minds as fragmented images rather than continuous motion, an effect mirrored in the film's structure.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Name two ways we know that La Jetée is about film.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Time travel: Film allows us to 'travel' in time, presenting moments from the past or potential futures.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Discontiguous pictures: Film, at its core, is a series of still images that create the illusion of movement. La Jetée explicitly exposes this structure.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
How is film imagined to be a "time machine?"
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{ Film has the capacity to capture moments in time and preserve them for future viewing. It allows us to revisit the past or envision potential futures, effectively manipulating and playing with our experience of time.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one piece of evidence that this film reflects on the recent experience of war?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The scenes of a devastated post-war world, the underground setting, and the imagery reminiscent of concentration camps all suggest a reflection on the horrors of World War II, a conflict still fresh in the memory of the film's creation.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}


\section{Technofutures and the Secret Life of Robots}
\subsection{2001: A Space Odyssey}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kubric's use of weird shapes in interiors:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How do they throw the human off-
kilter? Make us question our
understanding and mastery of our
environment? Give us a deeply
embodied experience?
        \item Thought-provoking, disorients space, what is our place in space?
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Continuous Editing:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Knits space together, making it feel cohesive and easy to conceptualize
        \item Naturalized and intended to be invisible
        \item Dominant in commercially popular film
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discontinuous Editing:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Creates associations between separate things
        \item Meant to instill an idea about the associations or be disruptive
        \item Exists in commercially popular film but often more dominant in experimental film
        \item In 2001, they used \textbf{graphic match/match cut}, where similar looking but very different objects are cut/faded together to create continuity. Bone represents the first use of tech/tools by men, and the moving spaceship represents man's latest ventures, documenting how far we've come. Note how the first tool we used/made was a weapon to destroy and kill, how we use violence and control to advance/move forward, evolution is inherently colonial. How the ship becomes the most evil being in the ship. What does technology mean, how does it transform us, how do we transform it: bidirectional relationship. The multi-valent role of technology: technology is advancement, evolution but is also violence and colonization. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item The monkeys: we are the monkeys, when we first touched the obelisk and when we touch it again
    \item \textbf{Movement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conceptual movement (through special effects)
        \item Physical movement
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Special Effects:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More than just iconography
        \item Making us see allusions that are meant to be shown as allusions: not trying to trick us
        \item Freedman: \enquote{Special effects … not only use the visual
(and, often, musical) resources peculiar
to cinema to an unusually
thoroughgoing degree, but also
incorporate an overt recognition of this
fact. Whereas the realistic film … strives
after an art to conceal art, special
effects self-consciously de-conceal their
own artfulness by overtly glorifying in
the various technologies of filmmaking.
Special effects … are always about film
itself}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Human-human relationship and the Banality of Humans}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Human-human interactions are rare and when present, dull
        \item How humans become more machine-like than real machines (Hal) note similarities to Metropolis. 
        \item Hal more human/emotional than humans? 
        \item What's the purpose of humans existing if machine is more than what we are
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sounds}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hal's acousmatic voice: Gives it an ominous, controlling, god-like character
        \item The voice resembles humanity, yet not fully. The calmness. We are seeing so much humanity in something that is clearly not human, putting humans in a non-human box. 
        \item A surveillance state: Hal can see and hear everything
        \item A lot of diagetic sound but not a lot of diagetic speech
        \item Blue Danube Waltz played during the establishing shot of the spaceship: elegance, contrast with violence. Note opening scene: black screen with sound
    \end{itemize}
    \item Change from concrete representation to the abstract in the end:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Order for chaos, exchanging sense for nonsense: the universe is so big
        \item We are rushed to interpret scenes instantaneously
        \item The strong sense of "moving forward" in time, changes our perspective within the film. We're no longer just an observer of things, we we being pulled into the abstract imagery. Note the use of extreme close-ups that depersonalizes people (ie. the ECU of the human eye looks like Hal)
        \item The star child: we are reborn. We return to a point where we can't remember, comprehend or speak. We are similar to the monkeys in a sense, figuring things out. 
        \item Seeing one's own death: where did I come from, where am I going
        \item This part of the film more about what we feel, rather that what it means
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{exercise}
Most of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey employs slow, concrete, and technical representation. Near the end ("Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite"), images are suddenly very abstract. What is one reason you think Kubrick makes this switch? If you cannot think of a reason, how does this switch change your perspective within the film?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Possible Answers:  Kubrick shifts to abstraction to represent transcendence beyond human understanding; to reflect  the overwhelming scale or alien nature of the universe; to force the audience to abandon rational interpretation and instead engage the film emotionally and experientially.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is discontinuous editing?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Discontinuous editing is a style where cuts between shots are meant to be noticeable, creating juxtaposition, drawing attention to itself, or provoking a specific mental association in the viewer.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is a graphic match?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{A graphic match is a type of edit where two shots with similar shapes, compositions, or visual elements are cut together to create a sense of visual continuity or thematic association.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one possible interpretation of Kubric's graphic match (the bone?)
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The graphic match from bone to spaceship could symbolize humanity's leap in technological advancement, the ongoing connection between violence and progress, or the idea of  tools shaping human evolution.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one way that 2001 asks us to think about the theme of film as tech?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{2001 foregrounds the technological aspects of filmmaking, with its special effects acting as a spectacle and drawing attention to the constructed nature of the cinematic experience.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
In which way could we say 2001 is about special effects?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{2001  uses special effects in a self-aware way, not simply to create an illusion of reality but to highlight the capabilities of film technology and provoke thought about the medium itself.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
How are humans represented in 2001?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Humans are often portrayed as dull, emotionless, and reliant on technology.  Their interactions are sterile and formal, contrasting  with the more dynamic and seemingly emotional AI, HAL 9000.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Name one effect of the film's use of music and sound.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Possible Answers: The use of classical music creates a sense of grandeur or irony; HAL's calm voice makes him seem  ominous; the contrast between silence and diegetic sound emphasizes the isolation of space.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one difference of representation between human-human relationships and human-machine relationships?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Human-human relationships are depicted as cold and formal, while human-machine interactions (especially with HAL) seem to have more emotional depth and complexity.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Name an experiential or perspectival difference between the first three parts of the film and the final part?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Possible Answers:  The first three parts have a slower pace and a more concrete, narrative focus;  the final part is abstract, visually overwhelming, and forces the viewer to abandon linear interpretations in favor of  a more emotional, intuitive response.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}



\section{Technophobia and the Surveillence of states}
\subsection{THX1138}
George Lucas: \enquote{THX 1138 is how I saw 1970. It was
designed as a metaphor for the
way we were living at the time. The
world has taken a strange twist
from there, but I think the ideas
that we examined in THX 1138 are
still valid in the 21st century}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The use of a lot of extreme close-ups (ECUs)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Creates a feel of unease: we don't feel safe and comfortable
        \item Outlines the invasion of the character's privacy, no sense of personal space, we are inside the characters' \enquote{space}, we feel the residual anxiety of what the characters feel
        \item CUs \& ECUs come across to us very differently: CUs give us emotional intimacy, ECUs objectifies face, strip character of humanity \& individuality, induces cluster-phobia. When you're so close, you are close to the materiality of the human.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Representation of space} (complete white space)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Void of nothingness, the \textbf{sterility}. The illusion that the characters are trapped in a space, a space detached from reality, like a prison, no way to get in, no way to let out. No walls to flip through, nowhere to escape. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Communism and Capitalism}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collectivity and conformism, mass production
        \item What is seen as God is like a big brother/comrade
        \item Repression of sexuality at the time: hetero treated almost like homo
    \end{itemize}
    \item Habermas: \enquote{The progressive 'rationalization' of society is
linked to the institutionalization of scientific and
technical development … Marcuse is convinced
that what Weber calls "rationalization" realizes not
rationality as such but rather, in the name of
rationality, a specific form of unacknowledged
political domination}
    \item \textbf{Media Consumption and Anti-Blackness}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A world of only white people (pretty much), yet black people only exits in virtuality, like holograms, porn videos etc.
        \item Critique of media assumption: makes you docile, like taking pills
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Testing scene}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The scene when all the robots and things plug things into THX's nose and holes.
        \item Use of ECU: defamiliarizes the face of THX
        \item Highlighting our own experiences, invasive medical tests, \enquote{body on a table}, dehumanization
        \item Looks like a factory, not a medical facility. He is being treated like how he treated a robot, assembly things etc. Treated like object, condescendence.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Excercise of power: surveillence}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sound gets everywhere, no place is not watched. 
        \item People are not just being watched by one central entity, everyone is watching each other, the \textbf{mutual surveillance}. The person being watched is also the person watching
        \item \textbf{The panopticon}: theoretical prison model, all cells located radially around a guard tower in the center: the discipline works by knowing they can be watched, yet not when. This enforces self-discipline, extending to how our society works similarly.
        \item Human speech and conversation overshadowed by machine voice, implying the importance and power dynamics? Machine noises are pre-recorded. Sounds, even from humans sound acousmatic, it doesn't seem natural. You don't know where the voice is coming from. Very chaotic space. Sense of eavesdropping, everyone is being listened to.
        \item \textbf{Control Society}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Source of power is visible
            \item Enforced by demonstrations of force
            \item Power managed by central authority
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Disiplinary Society}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Source of power is invisible
            \item Enforced by mass surveilance
            \item Power managed by social institutions
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Surveillance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Surveillance vs. 2001: 2002 explicitly emphasizes Hal, surveillance expressed through the camera and sound in a confined spaceship. In THX, it is all about mass surveillance, we barely see cameras, but we all know that everyone is being surveilled.
    \end{itemize}
    \item "But if technology proceeds from ..... intense rationality" (Habermas 56) (technology infantilize human beings)
\end{itemize}
\begin{exercise}
What are two examples of the camera "performing" visual surveillance?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The extreme close-ups on characters' faces, creating a sense of intrusion into their private space.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Shots that frame characters within cramped spaces or emphasize the white, sterile environments, suggesting a lack of freedom and constant monitoring.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Describe two examples of sound and explain what they tell us about the world of the film.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The overlapping layers of machine noises, voices, and announcements create a disorienting soundscape, highlighting the omnipresent surveillance and lack of privacy.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The acousmatic voices (where the source is unseen) that give commands or instructions emphasize the invisible power structures and the characters' lack of control.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one way that extreme close-ups function differently than close-ups?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Extreme close-ups fragment and objectify the human subject, stripping away individuality and emotional connection. Close-ups can still convey intimacy and emotional depth.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one motivation behind the use of extreme close-ups?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{To emphasize the dehumanization of the characters within a repressive, surveillance-heavy society. The close-ups become invasive and uncomfortable, mirroring the experience of the characters.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one way that THX displays Habermas's critique of the rationalization of society through institutionalized science?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The film portrays a society where scientific and technological control is used to suppress individuality, enforce conformity, and maintain power structures. This reflects Habermas's concern about the way "rationalization" can become a form of domination.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one way that THX is a product of its time?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The film reflects anxieties of the late 1960s and early 1970s about the rise of surveillance technologies, the erosion of privacy, and the potential for social control through technology.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}





\section{The Space Within}
\subsection{Solaris}
\textbf{Tarkovsky}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Not interesting in exploring how science can bring men forward
    \item Does not like science fiction conventions, i.e. special effects, he thinks that it distracts
    \item Note earlier we talked about scifi being images of wonder, not necessarily as demonstrated here. Note no fancy spacesuits, set etc.
    \item Trying to change scifi with Solaris: not about how cool you can make effects look, but that men needs a mirror, to look back, to reflect. He's reimagining the entire genre. Solaris is Tarkovsky's answer to Kubric's 2001 which he hated
    \item Hari: embodiment of both the most human and the most alien
    \item His reflections on science fiction:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \enquote{I don't like science fiction, as I don't like to escape life}
        \item \enquote{As for \textit{Solaris}, my decision to adapt it to the screen is not at all a result of
some fondness for the genre}
        \item \enquote{[I never thought] of Solaris as a science-fiction film – although I do feel that
Solaris is the least successful of my films because I was never able to
eliminate the science-fiction association}
        \item \enquote{I do not believe the cinema has genres}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \enquote{Clearly Lem's concern with epistemological limits is of at least some
interest to Tarkovsky, but his approach and answer to the conundrums
of human knowledge is entirely different to Lem's, and as such is in fact
antithetical to the aims and objectives of science fiction literature. His
aesthetic strategy for Solaris thus unequivocally endangers the
possibility of a science fiction cinema … In Tarkovsky's Solaris we
certainly encounter mysteries, but not cognitive value, not science
fiction}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Aesthetics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of circular shapes, tilt shot angles: implying something isn't quite right
    \item Hari: birth through light
    \item Hari: the grip of memory on the self, note the moment when hari grips Kris's head and gains agency
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Doubles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kris and Hari
    \item Mother and lover 
    \item The dacha and its solarian copy
    \item Burton, old and young, present and filmed
    \item Film is a tool to reflect on ourselves, a mirror
    \item Film should be about feeling, human morality and spirituality. Film is haunting, produces dangerous doubling as well as narcisistic projections
    \item Hari is begging to be real: she can feel pain (the copy more real than the original?)
    \item Our memory becomes the haunting copy of what is the original
    \item Closing shot: was Kelvin ever on Earth? Is Earth real? Is the emotional life real?
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
    Kubric wants to say that film should be more about the thoughts and messages delivered rather than fancy effects and entertainment. Film should be taken seriously. Note this collides with the perspective of science fiction being about images of wonder.
\end{remark}
\begin{exercise}
How would you describe Tarkovsky's attitude towards the sf genre?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Tarkovsky had a complex and somewhat dismissive attitude towards science fiction. He disliked traditional genre conventions, feeling they distracted from  deeper explorations of humanity and the inner self.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Name two ways that Solaris tries to depart from genre conventions of sf.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Minimal use of special effects or futuristic technology,  focusing instead on psychological and emotional states.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Emphasis on slow pacing, long takes, and a contemplative atmosphere rather than action or plot-driven narratives.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Why does Marvell argue that Solaris "endangers" science fiction?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Marvell believes Solaris subverts the core principles of science fiction, which typically emphasize exploring rational explanations and the cognitive value of the unknown. Tarkovsky's focus on the emotional and the unknowable challenges this tradition.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one point of tension between Solaris and 2001?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{2001 embraces technological spectacle and envisions a future shaped by human progress, while Solaris  rejects these elements and focuses on the limitations of human understanding and the emotional turmoil of the characters. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one reason that Solaris features so many doubles?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{The doubles in Solaris are a way to explore themes of memory, identity, and the fragility of reality. They represent the haunting echoes of our past and anxieties about the authenticity of our experiences.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one way that Solaris could be about film?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Solaris can be seen as a metaphor for filmmaking itself. The planet Solaris, with its ability to manifest memories, mirrors the act of creating a film that brings imagined realities to life. This suggests the power of cinema to examine our own inner worlds and question our perceptions.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}




\section{Urban Dystophia}
\subsection{Blade Runner 1982}
\begin{remark}
    Blade runner exhibits post-modernism. Note modernism vs. post-modernism. Unlike \textit{Solaris}, which lacked cognitive value, epidemiology, \textit{Blade Runner} is all about it.
\end{remark}
\textbf{Post-modernity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Late 20th century paradigm of thought and historical moment, usually also associated with cultural changes
    \item Shaped by late capitalism and commodification, increased global movement and commerce, climate anxiety, postcoloniality
    \item Reality no longer organized around stable centres of truth, but increasingly, multiple or fragmented (i.e. in \textit{Blade Runner}, upon first sight, you have no idea whether the person you're looking at is real or not)
    \item Reality and being increasingly seen as constructed and mutable
    \item Classical binaries are destabilized and no longer neatly organize our reality: human/nature, good/evil, mind/body
    \item The appearance of stimulations that become our reality
    \item Focus on image, representation, virtuality
    \item Postmodern art (in a different way than modern art) wants to expose or reveal the medium of its truth (like film)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{City mise-en-scene}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Grungy
    \item Disorientating
    \item Vignette of different cultures
    \item Diagetic lighting
    \item Mash up or various metropolises in real life, bits and pieces of each, supposed to be Los Angeles 
    \item Reality constructed by different references, citations of places, \textbf{citationalism}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Citationalism} Mash up of spatial and temporal references - the individual histories of which often get subsumed or lost in the construction of the new\

\textbf{Post-colonialism: }\enquote{This is also true of
geographical and space
exploration: when there is no
more virgin ground left to the
imagination, when the map
covers all the territory,
something like the reality
principle disappears. The
conquest of space constitutes,
in this sense, an irreversible
threshold which effects the loss
of terrestrial coordinates and
referentiality}

\textbf{Simulacrum} Image or representation beyond reality, yet basically accepted as reality. A pure simulacrum has no relation to any reality whatsoever. Note what changes after Rachel finds out that she's a replicant. In this situation, an existential crisis is triggered. The replicant is a perfect symbol of the postmodernic self, how the self gets deconstructed, becomes a commodity, a part of local commerce, a tool of capital, and the subject becomes and object. 

\textbf{Jean Baudrillard on the Simulacrum}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \enquote{models no longer constitute an imaginary
domain with reference to the real; they
are, themselves, an apprehension of the
real}
    \item \enquote{this indeed is simulation: not that these
factories are fake, but that they are real –
or hyperreal – and that by being so, they
send all ‘real’ production … into the same
hyperreality}
    \item \enquote{there is no more double; one is always
already in the other world, an other
world which is not another}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rene Descartes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \enquote{I think therfore I am}
    \item \enquote{I doubt therfore I am}, doubt being another kind of self-edifying thought that certifies
    \item Deckard meant to sound like him. He is a perfect representation of a replicant. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Eye \enquote{I} Motifs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dominance of the eye points to identy, to the subject-objectification
    \item Eye becomes the source of doubt. No how the eyes are not only for looking, they're also looked at
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Photograph becomes as reality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rachel's mother's photograph has substituted reality
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
    Blade runner vs. THX: blade runner tries to construct a society with hiearchical orders more familiar to us, e.g. police, whereas THX is a completely different society. In addition. blade runner's city represents a place destroyed by capitalism, whereas THX is ran completely by capital. Note difference to Metropolis: Metropolis ran on industrialization and production.
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
What is postmodernity?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Postmodernity is a complex historical period and a philosophical movement that emerged in the late 20th century. It's characterized by a skepticism towards grand narratives, the blurring of  boundaries (like high/low culture), a focus on surfaces and images, and a sense of fragmentation and instability of reality. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is a simulacrum?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{A simulacrum is a copy or representation that replaces the original and becomes accepted as reality in itself. It has no reference to an original reality, creating a world where distinctions between the real and the simulated are blurred.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is hyperreality?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Hyperreality is a condition where simulations and representations become more important and influential than the "real" world they were meant to reflect. In hyperreality, the boundaries between the real and the artificial collapse.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is citationalism?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Citationalism is a postmodern artistic practice where works of art heavily reference or incorporate elements from other existing works or cultural artifacts. It's a form of remixing and recontextualizing existing images and ideas.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Describe Blade Runner's city scape
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Blade Runner's cityscape is a grungy, disorienting, and densely layered urban environment. It reflects a blend of cultures,  a decaying world shaped by overconsumption and environmental decline, and a sense of constant surveillance. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
How do Blade Runner's characters use or experience photographs and films? How do we?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{In Blade Runner, photographs serve as tangible proof of memories and identity, even if those memories are implanted. The film raises questions about the extent to which photographs and films shape our own understanding of reality and our personal histories. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What happens to history in postmodernity?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Postmodernity challenges the idea of history as a linear progression. History becomes fragmented, contested, and often re-presented through pastiche, simulation, and subjective narratives.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Name one way that "eyes" symbolize I (identity)
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{The focus on eyes in Blade Runner highlights the characters' search for identity and the scrutiny they face. Eyes are both a means of seeing and being seen, symbolizing the instability of selfhood in a world of surveillance and replicas.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}














\section{Spectacular Bodies}
\subsection{The Fly}
\textit{The Fly} is an example of \textbf{body horror}

\textbf{Sublimity vs. Grotesque}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sublimity
    \begin{itemize}
        \item cognates: wonder, amazement, awe, astounding, striking, exciting
        \item appeals to abstraction
        \item makes one feel small and insignificant
    \end{itemize}
    \item Grotesque
    \begin{itemize}
        \item cognates: gross, disgusting, inimical, revolting, vile, repulsive
        \item appeals to concrete
        \item inspires fear or self-annihilation
        \item inherent in the perceived object (more ambiguously shared)
        \item related to perception of category-crossing/fusion
        \item violation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Similarities
    \begin{itemize}
        \item both surpass the rational mind
        \item both related to norms of scientific rationality
        \item both inspire shock or recoil
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
    Note how the further from human, the less grotesque, it's where the image resembles humanly features yet containing grossness that triggers the more reaction.
\end{remark}
\textbf{Representation of Ronald Regan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 80s: a belief in the states where men are becoming are less masculine, and men needs to go back to the masculine state in order to raise a family
    \item the gay antagonized, popular culture romanticizes a strong man, a strong body, naturally healthy 
    \item people with HIV, AIDS targeted and dehumanized
    \item media fantasizes an impenetrable, android body
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
    See how during this controversial era, \textit{The Fly} deteriorates man into a grotesque insect. Cronenberg is sending a message to the media.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Aliens}
\textbf{Station ducts and the body:} not letting the aliens, the outside, get into the inside


\textbf{Birth Grotesque:} the maggot in \textit{The Fly} vs. the kid in \textit{Aliens}

\textbf{Clean vs. bad postmodern body:} woman confronting the alien with the exoskeleton

\textbf{Misanthropy:} hatred of humankind, the character, neture or condition of a misanthrope.
\begin{itemize}
    \item often expressed aesthetically in grotesque imagery of humans or part of human bodies
    \item think about what might be liberating, satisfyinf, honest or revealing about reveling in misanthropic representations (e.g. hair growth)
    \item disease is not part of morality
\end{itemize}

Cronenberg: \enquote{I have to tell people
that some of the things
they think are repulsive
in my films are meant to
be repulsive, yes, but
there’s a beautiful
aspect to them to them
as well. There’s true
beauty in things that
others find repulsive.}

\begin{exercise}
How would you describe both the sublime and the grotesque?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The Sublime:  A feeling of awe and wonder mixed with fear, often inspired by experiences that overwhelm our rational comprehension, such as vast landscapes or powerful natural phenomena.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The Grotesque: An aesthetic characterized by the disturbing, repulsive, and often darkly humorous. It thrives on the violation of boundaries, the blending of categories, and the unsettling  depiction of the body.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is body horror?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Body horror is a subgenre of horror that focuses on the graphic destruction, mutation, or violation of the physical body. It often plays on our fears of  disease, decay, and the loss of bodily control.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is misanthropy?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Misanthropy is a general dislike, contempt, or hatred of humankind.  Misanthropic representations in art often depict humans in a grotesque or dehumanized manner.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
How is The Fly's representation of the human body different from heroic bodies in popular cinema in the 1980s?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{The Fly subverts the 1980s action hero trope with its graphic depiction of a deteriorating body. Instead of hyper-masculinity and physical prowess, it emphasizes decay, vulnerability, and the loss of human form.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Why is the AIDS epidemic a relevant context for The Fly?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{The AIDS epidemic fueled anxieties about bodily deterioration, disease, and the social stigmatization of those afflicted. The Fly can be seen as a reflection of these anxieties, with the protagonist's transformation mirroring the fears surrounding AIDS. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one of Cronenberg's motivations in providing this grotesque sort of representation?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Cronenberg uses the grotesque to challenge conventional notions of beauty and the body. He forces viewers to confront the physical realities of existence, often hidden or sanitized in mainstream representations. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one social taboo that Cronenberg crosses?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Cronenberg challenges taboos around disease, bodily disintegration, and the blurring of boundaries between human and non-human. His films often depict these themes in a graphic and unsettling way.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Describe one way a body horror aesthetic has been used to reflect anxieties about gender or sexual difference.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Body horror often employs imagery of bodily transformations and mutations that can be read as metaphors for anxieties about gender fluidity, sexual transgression, or the monstrous feminine.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}







\section{Alfrofuturism}
\subsection{Neptune Frost}
\textbf{Womack on Afrofuturism: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item \enquote{Afrofuturists redefine culture and
notions of blackness for today and the
future. Both an artistic aesthetic and a
framework for critical theory, Afrofuturism
combines elements of science fiction,
historical fiction, fantasy, Afrocentricity,
and magic realism with non-Western
beliefs. In some cases, it's a total
revisioning of the past and speculation
about the future with cultural critiques.}
    \item \enquote{All utilizing black
characters or aesthetics
to deconstruct images of
the past to revisualize
the future}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Style in afrofuturism: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item prominence of music
    \item costuming and make-up
    \item colors
    \item poetry
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
How do color and light hold us to the specificity of the Rwandan land and culture?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The film's vibrant color palette draws upon the traditional colors, fabrics, and aesthetics of Rwanda. The use of natural light enhances this, highlighting the beauty of the landscape and connecting the characters to their environment.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\textbf{Coltan (columbite-tantaline)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item metallicore
    \item mined from the earth
    \item used in many electronics, especially phones and laptops
\end{itemize}


Planned parenthood: \enquote{intersex is an umbrella term that describes bodies that fall outside the strict
male/female binary. There are lots of ways someone can be intersex.
Intersex is a general term used for a variety of situations in which a person is
born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit the boxes of “female”
or “male.”
Being intersex is a naturally occurring variation in humans, and it isn’t a medical
problem — therefore, medical interventions (like surgeries or hormone therapy)
on children usually aren’t medically necessary. Being intersex is also more
common than most people realize. It’s hard to know exactly how many people
are intersex, but estimates suggest that about 1-2 in 100 people born in the U.S.
are intersex}

\begin{remark}
    Black panther good example of alfro: the non-colonial setting where a native society thrives without the influence of the outside
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Alfrofuturism is a meditation on African tradition. Just because there are black actors or a film is written by black directors/screenwriters it does not necessarily make a film afrofuturistic.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    The futurism in alfro really gets expressed through CGI, perfumic effects and costumes. The technology is more surreal rather than real. This film is very auro, spiritual instead of popular tech due to geopolitical differences contrary to what the western world generically thinks about africa. Our relationship with tech is spiritual? When you don't know how some techs works and it's like magic.
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
What is Afrofuturism?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Afrofuturism is a cultural movement that uses science fiction, fantasy, and technology to reimagine the future  through a Black lens.  It  explores themes of the African diaspora, technology, history, and identity, and often challenges traditional Western science fiction narratives.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Which gaps in traditional Western science fiction does Afrofuturism address or transform?

\section{The Posthuman}
\subsection{Annihilation}
Garland: \enquote{And the most defining thing about
[the novel] was its atmosphere;
the specifics of plot were not as
crucial. Tone was very important.
I didn’t reread the book, which
was a dreamlike, slightly
hallucinatory novel. I did an
adaptation of my memory of the
novel, a slightly odd conceit.}
\textbf{Posthuman (Hyles's interpretation)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \enquote{Although these aspects foreground the cybernetic aspect of the posthuman, it is important
to recognize that the construction of the posthuman does not require the subject be a literal
cyborg. Whether or not interventions have been made on the body, new models of
subjectivity emerging from such fields as cognitve science and artificial life imply that even a
biologically unaltered Homo sapiens counts as posthuman. The defining characteristics
involve the construction of subjectivity, not the presence of nonbiological components}
    \item Subjectivity: will not dependent on anyone else
    \item Informational pattern over material substantiation
    \item Consciousness as epiphenomenon (contrast to centrality to human identify for Descartes)
    \item Body as aprothesis, so extending or replacing always part of our journey as humans
    \item Human seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines
    \item Different versions of the posthuman:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "cybernetic" figures in \textit{Blade Runner, Neptune Frost}
        \item "eco-humans" in \textit{The Fly} and especially in \textit{Annihilation} 
    \end{itemize} While these are not opposites, there is substantial overlap that will depend upon the representations
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Anthropocene: }Emphasize the central role of mankind in geology and ecology by proposing to use the term 'anthropocene' for the current geological epoch

Kara on \enquote{anthropocinema: }\enquote{What used to be regarded as fictional end-ofthe-world scenarios have become fact-based
speculations on the foreseeable consequences
of the Anthropocene}

\textbf{Mental Illness and cancer: }Lena is the least physically damaged, yet her moral damage was compared to the other women's mental and physiological illness. The status of illness is not clear in this film. Illness is so prominent in this film, why?

\textbf{Transformations, Reflection and Refraction: }Notice the visible refraction of light seen through the glass of water. Reflection also visible through mirrors. Film as a mirror.

\textbf{Use of backlighting to visualize "annihilation"}

\begin{exercise}
Describe the "posthuman". What are two of the forms this figure can take?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The posthuman is a concept that challenges traditional notions of what it means to be human. Key characteristics include: subjectivity redefined,  consciousness as secondary, bodies as changeable, and seamless integration with technology.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Forms of the Posthuman: The "cybernetic" figure: Humans augmented with technology (ex: Blade Runner, Neptune Frost); The "eco-human":  Humans profoundly intertwined and transformed by their environment  (ex:  The Fly,  Annihilation)}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What are at least two ways that humans become posthuman in Annihilation?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Genetic Mutation: Characters undergo physical transformations influenced by the Shimmer, blurring the boundaries between human and other forms of life.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Hybrid Consciousness: The film suggests the possibility of consciousness existing beyond an individual body, hinting at a posthuman state where the self is distributed and fluid. }
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Identify one sublime image and one grotesque image in Annihilation.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Sublime: The vibrant, blooming flora inside the Shimmer, visually stunning yet unsettling due to its unnatural growth.}
\textcolor{blue}{Grotesque: The mutated creatures, especially the bear with the human-like voice, creating a sense of fear and revulsion through their distorted forms.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is one way Annihilation visualizes refraction and one way it visualizes reflection?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Refraction: The Shimmer's boundary itself distorts light, creating a mesmerizing and disorienting visual effect.}

\section{After World, After Film}
\subsection{WALL-E}
\textbf{Indexicality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \enquote{index} is a type of sign (other signs include symbols and icons)
    \item The index contains a physical trace of its reference
    \item \enquote{A sign connected to its object by a
concrete relationship, usually one of
causality or analogy}
    \item Examples of indeex
    \begin{itemize}
        \item footprint
        \item thumbprint
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{CGI: Prior vs. Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CGI is a totality rather than just perspectives in the past
    \item Note use of extreme long shots
    \item Loss of Earth expressed through the loss of photochemical film (very nature of film has shifted)
    \item Sobchack on the loss of film: \enquote{[T]he loss of photochemical ‘cinema’ as
the loss of the ‘real’ is also conflated
with the loss of terrestrial human life.}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{The return to earth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Human's return to their bodies
    \item Human's return to each other
    \item The return to old, mechanical age (WALL-E vs. Eve)
    \item The plant in the shoe: symbolizing \enquote{putting our feet back on earth} and walking
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Human vs. Automation/Animation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Elastic, alternating between bodies/shapes, very \enquote{motored} in cartoons
    \item Humans, are quite the contrary. We are static, inelastic. We envy that kind of absolute freedom in cartoons (what it will, what it can)
    \item Fat-phobia to the idea of not moving in \textit{WALL-E}
    \item Boot at the end of credits: introducing human labour behind film
    \item Corporate totality takes over humans
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Dimension of Physical Expression}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Silent actors in the past are cartoon-like: can't talk, need to talk through movement
    \item WALL-E: Nostalgia for the labour forces in the past babysitting the present
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
    Sobchack on the effortfulness of being human: \enquote{There is, of course, a paradox in our weary longing for and elation at watching plasmatic ease, and this is that the very labour of living is our most primal work and that which most enlivens us.}
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Technophobia: not from automation alone. Note picture of the captains: manipulated by automation in the long term? Automation may be thinking what is best for the human? Autonomy is not clear in the movie. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Note how the robots are behaving more humanly than humans: Eve's memory and consciousness, \textit{WALL-E}holding hands and being emotional. The robots were just imitating what the humans were doing? Film about regaining the humanity that everyone lost - even physically, the people's bodies have evolved into what we don't perceive as normality. Body horror? Though not exactly like in films like \textit{The Fly}. Also a critique on corporate capitalism?
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
Why does Sobchack bring automation and animation together to explain WALL-E?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Sobchack connects automation and animation to highlight the contrast between the boundless, fluid bodies of the robots and the immobile, passive humans. This contrast embodies our longing for the effortless ease depicted in animated figures while paradoxically affirming the value of the lived human experience.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Which of WALL-E's characters are both automated and animated?

\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is indexicality?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Indexicality refers to signs that have a direct, physical relationship to their referents. Unlike symbols (arbitrary signs), an index bears a trace or consequence of the thing it represents (like a footprint left in the sand).}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Name at least two images of or references to film in WALL-E.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{WALL-E's fascination with old movie musicals (e.g., Hello Dolly!) and his collection of physical film reels.}
\item \textcolor{blue}{The use of silent-film-era physical comedy and gestures to express  emotions, especially by WALL-E.}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What are some characteristics of animated figures?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Fluidity of form: Animated figures can morph and change shapes in ways impossible for humans.}
\item Exaggerated expressions: Emotions are conveyed boldly and expressively.
\item Physical resilience: Animated bodies often defy gravity and can withstand extreme forces.
\end{itemize}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Why do viewers say the film is nostalgic?
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textcolor{blue}{ \textit{WALL-E} evokes nostalgia for:
Silent-era cinema: Physical comedy, reliance on visuals for storytelling; A simpler time:  Before technology dominated human life; Human connection: lost to isolation and over-reliance on automation.}

\item \textbf{Science Fiction's Paradox}: The essay argues that science fiction grapples with big ideas and explores possibilities beyond our current reality. However, the film medium, with its emphasis on visuals, can struggle to capture this philosophical depth. Instead, films might prioritize spectacle and action over complex themes.

\item \textbf{Horror vs. Sci-Fi}: The essay differentiates between horror and sci-fi through their core anxieties and visual focus. Horror  often centers on primal fears of the body and the unknown, while sci-fi explores the wonders of the possible and challenges our understanding of reality. Horror tends to use visuals to depict inward fears, while sci-fi uses them to explore the vastness of the external world.

\item \textbf{The Two Faces of Special Effects}: Special effects can be a powerful tool in sci-fi cinema, allowing filmmakers to visually represent fantastical concepts. However, an overreliance on spectacle can reduce complex ideas to mere awe and diminish the audience's imagination. 

\item \textbf{The Case of Frankenstein}: The essay uses Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as an example. The novel is a philosophical exploration of scientific ambition and its consequences. However, the film adaptation leans more heavily on horror elements, focusing on the monstrous creation and its rampage.

\item \textbf{The Rise of the Child in Sci-Fi}: The essay notes a recent trend in sci-fi films featuring children prominently. This might be linked to the success of films like\textit{ Star Wars} and \textit{E.T.}, which emphasized a sense of childlike wonder. However, this focus can come at the expense of intellectual engagement, prioritizing emotional connection over complex ideas.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Connection to Films: A Tale of Two Cities}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{2001: A Space Odyssey (1968):} This film exemplifies the careful balance between spectacle and philosophical exploration. Director Stanley Kubrick uses awe-inspiring visuals  to depict humanity's journey through space and evolution. The enigmatic ending leaves audiences pondering questions about  technology, existence, and our place in the universe. The film doesn't spoon-feed answers; instead, the visuals serve as a springboard for deep contemplation. 

\item \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):} This neo-noir sci-fi film by Ridley Scott  showcases a visually stunning future Los Angeles, drenched in rain and neon lights. However, the dazzling cityscape is not merely eye candy. It reflects the decay and moral ambiguity of the world. The film grapples with complex questions about  what it means to be human, particularly through the lens of replicants (bioengineered beings). The stunning visuals enhance the film's exploration of identity, memory, and empathy. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
These two films demonstrate how science fiction cinema can achieve  a successful balance. They don't shy away from  showcasing  the wonders of the future, but they use those visuals to serve a larger purpose. The spectacle is not an end in itself, but a tool to  provoke thought and discussion about complex ideas. This analysis highlights the tension  explored in the reading: cinema's potential to capture the essence of sci-fi while also  risking  to prioritize visuals over intellectual engagement. Films like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner navigate this tension  by using spectacle to  illuminate  philosophical themes,  ultimately achieving a richer and more rewarding viewing experience. 

\subsection{Technophilia: Technology, Representation and the Feminine }
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Traditional View of the Body:}  The essay presents the body as traditionally viewed as finite, limited, and opposed to the abstract and theoretical. Technology challenges this view. 
\item \textbf{Technology and Gender:} Science fiction emerged in the face of rapid technological advancement. The genre often explores how technology alters the concept of the body and impacts gender roles.
\item \textbf{The Mechanical Woman:}  L'Eve Future by Villiers de l’Isle-Adam is a significant text exploring the concept of the artificial woman.  This text, along with Edison's work, highlights that cinema is implicated in this fascination.
\item  \textbf{The Maternal and the Mechanical:} The essay argues that fascination with the artificial woman is often accompanied by anxieties about technology displacing the maternal. Motherhood plays a crucial role in these texts. 
\item \textbf{Metropolis and the Machine-Woman:} Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1926) is used as an example. The film depicts male anxiety about powerful technology, often embodied in female figures and associated with sexuality. The film also explores desires to use technology to usurp the maternal role.
\item \textbf{Alien and the Monstrous Maternal:} The Alien franchise depicts the maternal as monstrous and dangerous. The films challenge traditional notions of reproduction and gender by showcasing males giving birth and blurring sexual differences. These films align with Kristeva's concept of the abject – something both horrifying and captivating. 
\item \textbf{Blade Runner and the Loss of History:}  Blade Runner delves into anxieties surrounding artificial reproduction, and the potential loss of history it represents. Replicants seek photographs and memories as a way to ground themselves in the past, reflecting our reliance on maternal origins. The advanced technology in the film fetishizes the act of viewing but serves to disorient our sense of the real.
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{5pt} 

\textbf{Connections to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920):}  This German Expressionist film predates the sci-fi genre's rise but explores distorted views of reality.  Its visual style and focus on the internal psyche connect with the ways sci-fi uses visuals to address internal anxieties and philosophical questions rather than just showcasing technology.  

\item \textbf{Godzilla (1954):} While a monster movie, Godzilla can be seen as an exploration of anxieties following nuclear development. It reflects fears of technology's power and the potential for unintended consequences. Its city-destroying spectacle taps into the visual power of science fiction to explore societal concerns. 

\item \textbf{THX 1138 (1971):}  Like Metropolis, this film presents a dystopian vision where technology is oppressive. While less focused on gender than the essay discusses, it warns of the dangers of technological control. The sterile, dehumanized visuals amplify the fear of losing individuality within an overly ordered technological society.  

\item \textbf{Neptune Frost (2021):} This recent Afrofuturist film challenges typical sci-fi tropes with a unique visual style and themes of resistance to oppressive technology. It may offer a counterpoint to the essay's arguments about anxieties and instead showcase the potential for technology to empower marginalized communities.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt} 

The essay explores a central tension in science fiction cinema: its fascination with technology and its potential implications for concepts of the body, gender, and the maternal.  While the films analyzed focus on anxieties, it's important to see that sci-fi is not always bound by that perspective. It can also express diverse hopes, fears, and imaginative explorations of what technology could do to, or for, humanity. 

\subsection{The imagination as disaster}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sci-Fi Formulas:}  The essay posits that science fiction films often follow predictable narrative tropes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Global threat scenario: Aliens, monsters, disaster, international cooperation 
        \item Local threat scenario: Isolated town, skeptical hero discovers danger 
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Focus on Spectacle:} Sci-fi films excel in depicting destruction – mutated creatures, battles, collapsing cities. This emphasis on the visual aligns with the film medium.

\item \textbf{Science as Background:} While the genre is named for science, films often prioritize thrills over scientific accuracy in service to the visual spectacle.

\item \textbf{Disaster Themes:}  Sci-fi films tap into primal fears about the end of the world,  offering a cathartic experience of confronting overwhelming threats. 

\item \textbf{Aesthetics of Destruction:} Sci-fi films depict the destructive power of  technology, exploring beauty within chaos. This taps into the human curiosity towards the macabre.

\item \textbf{Moral Simplification:}  Sci-fi often presents clear-cut good vs. evil conflicts.  Aliens or "freaks" offer an outlet for righteous aggression, and destruction becomes a spectacle to be enjoyed.  This allows for a morally easy release.

\item \textbf{Technology as Focus:}  Films portray objects, machines, and settings as sources of power versus the relative helplessness of humans. 

\item \textbf{Scientists as Ambiguous Figures:} Scientists in these films are driven either by good or obsession, representing society's complex relationship with science as both savior and potential doom.

\item \textbf{Nuclear Trauma:}  Many sci-fi films act as metaphors for nuclear war anxieties. Monsters awakened by radiation or devastated planets mirror the real-world fear of nuclear annihilation.

\item \textbf{Wishful Thinking and War Spectacle:}  Sci-fi offers a fantasy of international unity against a common enemy, alongside action sequences mirroring war films. This simplifies complex issues and gives an outlet for aggression.

\item \textbf{Anxiety about Depersonalization:} A key theme is the fear of losing individuality or being "taken over."  This taps into anxieties about conformity and the alienating aspects of modern life. 

\item \textbf{Inadequate Response to Terror:} The essay argues that sci-fi films perpetuate oversimplified responses to complex fears like nuclear destruction. The films normalize and even neutralize terror through exciting distractions and familiar clichés.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connection to Studied Films}

 \textbf{Metropolis (1927):}
     \textbf{The Spectacle of Inequality:} The film's iconic visuals with the towering city above and the subterranean worker's city highlight the anxieties explored in the essay. This spectacle is not merely about fantastical technology but actively comments on social division and the potential for technology to be used as a tool of oppression.
     \textbf{Dehumanization and Revolt:} The depiction of the workers as a faceless, robotic mass directly taps into the fear of dehumanization under a totalitarian system. This connects to the essay's discussion of alien invaders representing the fear of being stripped of individuality. The worker's later revolt also echoes the essay's points about sci-fi tropes (threat, scientific solution). 

 \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):}
     \textbf{Visuals as Philosophy:} The film's rain-soaked, neon-drenched vision of Los Angeles is integral to the exploration of what it means to be human. The spectacle of the cityscape is a direct reflection of the internal conflicts around identity, memory, and empathy faced by both real humans and replicants.
     \textbf{Moral Ambiguity of the Scientist:} While not the central figure, Tyrell, the creator of the replicants, embodies the scientist as an ambiguous force. His technological genius results in sentient beings, but his motivations are questionable. This reflects the essay's point about scientists as potential figures of both salvation and destruction.
     \textbf{Technology vs. Humanity:}  Despite the thrilling action sequences, Blade Runner's core anxiety is about being replaced or superseded by technology.  The replicants, visually indistinguishable from humans, embody the fear of dehumanization discussed in the essay.

\vspace{5pt}

Both Metropolis and Blade Runner illustrate the potential of sci-fi cinema to go beyond mere spectacle. They use stunning visuals and futuristic settings to explore complex anxieties about class division, identity, and the dehumanizing potential of technology. These films align with the essay's argument that science fiction, at its best, can use spectacle as a way to grapple with profound anxieties of the modern era.

\subsection{Godzilla and the Japanese Nightmare}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Japan's Unique Cold War Position:} Japanese Godzilla films offer a unique perspective on the post-WWII world due to the country's experience with atomic bombing and American occupation. Unlike the stark "us vs. them" narrative common in American sci-fi, these films explore the complexities of Japan's relationship with the US.

\item \textbf{Godzilla as a Symbol of Trauma:} Godzilla embodies Japan's anxieties about nuclear war and the US military presence. The monster's origin story is directly linked to nuclear testing, forcing the country to confront its past.

\item \textbf{Transference vs. Projection:} The essay argues that Japanese monster films operate on the principle of "transference" rather than "projection." In psychoanalysis, transference involves projecting feelings about one person onto another. Godzilla is a stand-in for the US and the threat it represents, but also for Japan's own anxieties about industrialization and modernization.

\item \textbf{Evolving Morality:} In films like Mothra, monsters shift from purely destructive forces to figures with ambiguous or even positive intentions. This suggests a changing perspective on Japan's Westernization and the complexities of global politics.

\item \textbf{Reconstructing Society:} The introduction of child characters in later Godzilla films reflects the stabilizing Japanese society post-WWII. The roles of reporter, photographer, and child symbolize a "nuclear family" constructed around confronting anxieties and rebuilding.

\item \textbf{Godzilla 1985: A Nuclear Warning:}  This film provides a retrospective on the atomic bombings and critiques the escalating nuclear tensions of the 1980s. Japan's refusal to use nuclear weapons becomes a central theme. Godzilla becomes both a symbol of nuclear threat and a force of nature beyond the East-West dichotomy.

\item \textbf{Godzilla's Enduring Message:} The unresolved endings of many Godzilla films imply a continuous process of confronting past traumas and re-examining the present. The monster becomes a recurring symbol of unaddressed anxieties and a call for continued critical reflection. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}

\textbf{Connections to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927):} Thematically, Metropolis echoes the social anxieties that Godzilla embodies. The film explores class conflict, rapid technological advancement, and the dehumanizing potential of industrialization - forces present in Japan's post-war reconstruction.  

\item \textbf{THX 1138 (1971):}  Like Godzilla 1985, this film offers a critique of a repressive, highly controlled society. Both films use stark visuals to portray the dangers of conformity and the importance of independent thought within totalitarian systems.

\item \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):}  Both Blade Runner and Mothra explore the boundaries of what defines humanity. The replicants' struggle for autonomy mirrors questions about Japan's shifting identity in relation to Westernization and technological advancement. 

\item \textbf{WALL-E (2008):}   WALL-E's lonely struggle against consumerism and ecological decline echoes the theme of humanity at odds with nature seen in some Godzilla narratives. Both warn about the consequences of neglecting the balance between industrialization and the environment.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}

The passage argues that Godzilla films, far from being simplistic monster movies, provide a complex lens for examining Japan's unique historical experiences and anxieties about nuclear power. These films encourage the audience to confront uncomfortable truths and challenge prevailing Cold War narratives. Thematically and visually, they share strong links to other landmark science fiction films while contributing their own distinct cultural perspective. 

\subsection{Time Travel, Primal Scene and the Critical Dystopia}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Appeal of Dystopia:} The Terminator presents a dystopian vision of the future, stemming from our increasing reliance on technology.  This type of critical dystopia goes beyond spectacle, suggesting present-day trends that could lead to a bleak future.

\item \textbf{Machines and Ambiguity:}  The film explores the blurring of lines between humans and machines. The Terminator is a cyborg, and the heroes use technology to survive. This avoids a simplistic good vs. evil narrative.

\item \textbf{Time Travel and Primal Desires:}  The core plot of The Terminator utilizes a time-loop paradox which resonates with our primal scene fantasy (the desire to witness/participate in one's conception). This allows both narrative complexity and wish fulfillment for the audience.

\item \textbf{Freud and Fantasy:}  The Terminator engages with Freudian concepts of fantasy. Time travel stories play on our desires and offer disguised wish-fulfillment, even when dealing with dark subjects like incest. Films manipulate viewer identification, allowing us to inhabit different subject positions for complex emotional engagement.

\item \textbf{Fantasy vs. Reality:} The essay draws a line between merely escapist fantasy and works that "tread the path from fantasy back to reality."  The Terminator achieves this through its grounding in the everyday; technology in the film is a heightened version of our current reality, making the threat feel tangible.

\item \textbf{Sexual Difference in Sci-Fi:} With traditional gender roles becoming blurred, sci-fi films provide space to explore anxieties about sexual difference.  The Terminator uses the human/machine conflict as a proxy for this investigation. However, some sci-fi films revert to conservative ideas about motherhood and female identity (like Aliens).

\item \textbf{The Erotic Formula:}  Successful sci-fi romances often play on extreme difference: alien/human, future/present, etc.  Death or the threat of it heightens desire in this formula. The Terminator's love scene gains power because Kyle is from a doomed future, making their connection both passionate and poignant.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connections to studied films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927):}  Like The Terminator, concerns about technology and its potential for oppression drive the narrative.  The iconic imagery of the enslaved workers and the Maschinenmensch foreshadow later anxieties about the human/machine relationship.  

\item \textbf{THX 1138 (1971):}  George Lucas's dystopian vision shares the concern about a future where technology dehumanizes and controls the populace.  Both films offer a stark warning about the potential misuse of technological advancement.

\item \textbf{Solaris (1972):}  While Tarkovsky's film is more cerebral, it shares the theme of blurred lines between reality, memory, and constructed identities.  Both films challenge our perceptions and make us question the nature of existence itself.

\item \textbf{WALL-E (2008):}  This seemingly child-oriented film also functions as a critical dystopia with its vision of an Earth abandoned due to rampant consumerism and technological dependence.  The Terminator presents a darker view, but both films raise questions about our trajectory.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}

The Terminator stands out as a critical dystopian sci-fi film.  It uses spectacle in service of its message, not as a replacement for it.  The exploration of time travel taps into deep psychological desires, making the film more than just an action spectacle.  By examining the connections to other sci-fi films, we see patterns of how the genre addresses issues of technology, identity, and the human condition in both visually engaging and intellectually stimulating ways.

    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Time Travel Beyond Sci-Fi:} The essay looks beyond conventional science fiction and identifies time travel themes in works like Proust's \textit{In Search of Lost Time} as well as Conrad's \textit{Heart of Darkness}. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Internal vs. External Journeys:} This raises the idea that time travel isn't always about a physical journey, but might represent internal exploration of memory and self-discovery.
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Invisibility and Cinematic Parallels:} The essay connects the experience of time travel to that of being a film viewer, suggesting that both involve disengagement from conventional reality.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Alienation and Audience:} This explores the sense of isolation and shifting perspectives an audience experiences, which might link to the themes of alienation within time travel stories.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connection to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927):}  Class and worker divisions in Metropolis could link to the concepts of uneven development explored in the essay. Technological control and exploitation resonate strongly in both.

\item \textbf{La Jetée (1962):} Connects directly to the detailed analysis in the second part of the essay, focusing on trauma and cyclical time.

\item \textbf{THX 1138 (1971):}  Like the essay, THX 1138 depicts a world of control and manipulation. The loss of individuality and the fear of the future are shared thematic concerns. 

\item \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):} Deals with 'artificial' life and what constitutes being human. The essay raises ideas about regression or devolution, which could be explored through the replicants and their desire to defy their limited lifespans.

\item \textbf{The Fly (1986):}  The body-horror aspect of The Fly exemplifies the primal anxieties of technology gone wrong, leading to potential devolution, that the essay mentions.

\item \textbf{Neptune Frost (2021):} Might deal with themes involving marginalized communities, repurposing technology, and exploring alternate visions of the future, depending on the specific focus of the essay.

\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
The essay likely concludes by reiterating the complexities of time travel as a cinematic device in the sci-fi genre. It may highlight the tension between the desire to explore vast possibilities and the limitations of the visual medium itself.



\subsection{Kubrick's 2001 and the Possibility of a Science-Fiction Cinema}

\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Kubrick and the Contradiction of Sci-Fi Film:}  Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey exposes a central tension in science fiction cinema: the anti-intellectual bias of special effects undermines the genre's core potential for critical thought. 

\item \textbf{Special Effects as Spectacle:} Science fiction films often prioritize dazzling visuals over complex ideas, transforming into visually impressive exercises but conceptually hollow experiences (Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind).

\item \textbf{Kubrick's Solution:} While embracing special effects, Kubrick dialectically addresses the issue of intellectual banality. The film's characters are deliberately  dull, contrasting with the awe-inspiring visuals and the implied intelligence behind the monoliths. This contrast highlights  humanity's limitations and the need for evolution.

\item \textbf{The Limitations of the Solution:} Kubrick's method might be a one-off success;  2001  may stand as both the first and last fully realized cinematic science fiction. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connections to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Early Sci-Fi: Expressionism and Dystopian Futures:}  German Expressionist films like Metropolis and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari offer visually striking social critiques. Their distorted sets mirror the twisted inner worlds of characters or represent anxieties about urban life and technology. Kubrick's focus on intellectual emptiness could be a reaction to this earlier expression of technological unease.

\item \textbf{Solaris (Tarkovsky): Beyond Spectacle:}  Tarkovsky's Solaris focuses on internal struggles and existential questions, offering a counterpoint to spectacle-heavy sci-fi. Like 2001, the film features long, meditative sequences with minimal dialogue. However, it delves into memory, guilt, and the nature of reality, contrasting  2001's cosmic scale.

\item \textbf{THX 1138 and Dystopian Control:} George Lucas's visually stark THX 1138 shares 2001's portrayal of a sanitized, emotionally repressed future. However, THX 1138 focuses on the oppressive power of the state, while  2001 is more concerned with spiritual emptiness and the need for evolutionary leaps.

\item \textbf{The Body and Identity in Sci-Fi:} Both The Fly and Aliens use grotesque transformations and monstrous creatures to explore anxieties about bodily autonomy and the boundaries of the human. These films echo science fiction's literary roots, using the fantastical to examine the human condition. 

\item \textbf{Eco-Sci-Fi: }Finding Hope in Crisis: Films like \textit{WALL-E}and Annihilation use the sci-fi setting to critique human impact on the environment. \textit{WALL-E}offers a whimsical and almost silent journey, finding hope in simple emotions, while Annihilation is a visually haunting meditation on the alien and transformative nature of our world.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}

The essay's exploration of 2001 highlights how sci-fi films struggle to balance the genre's conceptual potential with cinema's visual power.  Some prioritize spectacle, while others lean toward more philosophical reflections. Examining different approaches sheds light on the possibilities of science fiction on film, showing how it can be a vehicle for both awe and critical thought. 



\subsection{Technophobia}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Conservative Technophobia in 1970s Cinema:}  This strain of sci-fi film often equates technology with the loss of individuality, freedom, and the dissolution of the traditional family unit.

\item \textbf{Nature as Antidote:} Films like \textit{THX 1138} present escaping technological society and entering 'nature' as the path to liberation, emphasizing the purity and unmediated quality of the natural world.

\item \textbf{Technology as Destructive to "Nature":}  These films suggest that technology dismantles concepts considered 'natural', undermining social hierarchies that conservative ideology attempts to present as inherent and immutable.

\item \textbf{The Rhetorical Strategy:} Conservative technophobic films intentionally eliminate middle ground, creating stark oppositions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Technology vs. Nature
        \item Equality vs. Liberty
        \item Artificial vs. Authentic
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Visuals as Reinforcers:}  Imagery (like the sun representing freedom) contributes to the sense of 'literal' truth that conservative ideology seeks, making social inequalities appear natural, not constructed.

\item \textbf{The Deconstructive Counter-Argument:}  A deconstructive analysis reveals that what conservative ideology claims are 'natural' origins are, in fact, the results of the very technology the films demonize.  The effect is misrepresented as the cause.

\item \textbf{\textit{Blade Runner} as Counterpoint:}  This film challenges the  technology/nature, reason/feeling dichotomies. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Depicts humans and replicants (androids) intertwining, blurring the line between 'maker' and 'creation'. 
        \item Analyzes capitalism as the force that turns humans into machines, echoing visual themes seen in \textit{Metropolis}.
        \item Ends with  ambiguity, privileging metaphorical interpretations and the constructed nature of relationships that conservative films try to naturalize.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connection to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{THX 1138} and \textit{Solaris} (Tarkovsky):} Both depict oppressive technological societies that control individuals. However, \textit{THX 1138} offers 'nature' as simple salvation.  \textit{Solaris}, on the other hand,  shows that escaping technology may not escape internal demons.  'Nature' itself may be an unknowable, even hostile force.

\item \textbf{\textit{Blade Runner} and \textit{Aliens}:}  Both films center on strong, capable female characters (Rachael, Ripley) within male-dominated settings.  However, \textit{Aliens} leans more towards action spectacle. While its themes of motherhood resonate, the potential critique of gender roles becomes backgrounded compared to \textit{Blade Runner's} overt examination of patriarchy's impact.

\item \textbf{\textit{The Fly} and Conservative Fears:}  The film, through its horrifying body transformation, could be read as a metaphor for the dangers of 'unnatural' tampering  with 'nature'. However, it can also be seen as a tragedy about losing control over the physical self, an anxiety that transcends ideology.

\item \textbf{\textit{Godzilla} and the Technological Sublime:}  While often categorized as monster movies, \textit{Godzilla} films tap into a deep awe at the power of something beyond human control and understanding. This echoes a key concept in Sci-Fi: the feeling of encountering that which is so vast, it forces us to rethink our place in the cosmos. 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}

The essay highlights a core tension within conservative critiques of technology in film. While aiming to reinforce traditional values, these films inadvertently expose the constructed nature of the social order they seek to uphold.  By comparing these films to others on your list, we broaden the discussion, seeing potential conservative anxieties play out in different genres and revealing that sci-fi, at its best, always invites multiple interpretations. 

\subsection{Technical Progress and the Social Life-World}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Two Cultures and the Life-World:} The essay explores the disconnect between the objective, measurable world of science, and the subjective, values-based "life-world" of society. It argues science struggles to directly inform the social and ethical issues that arise from its own progress. 

\item \textbf{Science and Social Impact:} Scientific knowledge equals power, but often technical power with few built-in guidelines for integrating discoveries into society thoughtfully. Literature explores these implications, but the essay seeks a more direct way for science itself to engage with the social consequences of its progress.

\item \textbf{The Historical Challenge:} The separation of science from everyday life is relatively recent. Universities once bridged the two cultures, but now hyperspecialization prioritizes technical proficiency over the broader humanistic understanding required to address science's impact.

\item \textbf{Technology vs. Democracy:} The essay examines how technical progress shapes society and whether democracy can effectively guide this force. Two models are explored:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Marxist Optimism:} Dismantling private ownership of the means of production puts technology in public hands, aligning progress with social goals. The essay critiques this, noting technical control doesn't equal democratic control.

        \item \textbf{Technology as Master:} Here, progress dictates social needs, not vice-versa.  New technologies create "objective exigencies" that replace political debate. The essay finds this overly pessimistic, too.
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{The Need for Mediation:}  The central problem is how to consciously and democratically manage the relationship between technical progress and our social lives, instead of leaving this to unplanned consequences.

\item \textbf{Beyond Mere Stability:} Technological rationality might provide efficiency, but at what cost? An over-focus on maximizing power and comfort could reduce values to mere survival, overlooking other human needs.

\item \textbf{The Challenge and Hope:} We are tasked with not just adapting to technology, but controlling it. This can only occur through rational, open dialogue, and not through technological solutions alone.

\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connection to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927):}  Visually stunning but explores the deep divide between technological advancement and social well-being.  Its iconic imagery of workers dehumanized by machinery warns of the dangers of unchecked progress without ethical consideration.

\item \textbf{Godzilla (1954):} While a monster movie, it is a direct response to nuclear technology. It embodies the fear and uncertainty unleashed by science on a scale beyond individual control, reflecting the essay's concerns about the mismatch between scientific power and social wisdom.

\item \textbf{Solaris (1972):} This film's alien world isn't about spectacle, but a mirror for human anxieties. It highlights how even "objective" science is shaped by subjective experience, mirroring the essay's point about the two cultures not being so neatly separable.

\item \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):}  Its futuristic setting serves as a backdrop to questions of identity, memory, and empathy. The line between human and replicant highlights anxieties about technology blurring the boundaries of what makes us human - a concern reflected in the essay. 

\item \textbf{WALL-E (2008):} A cautionary tale about technological overreliance and consumerism leading to social atrophy. It mirrors the essay's warning about prioritizing comfort and survival over meaningful values. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bodies of Fear: The Films of David Cronenberg}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cronenberg's Emphasis on the Body:} David Cronenberg's sci-fi horror films are distinct in their obsessive focus on the human body, its vulnerabilities, and its potential for grotesque transformations. This is a stark departure from traditional sci-fi that often uses the body as a vessel for exploring technological advancements or alien encounters.

\item \textbf{Rejection of Cartesian Dualism:} Cronenberg challenges the mind/body divide. His work suggests that mental processes, anxieties, and desires are inextricably linked to and often directly manifest in the flesh. This subverts the notion of the mind as a superior, controlling entity. 

\item \textbf{Technology and the Body:} Technology in Cronenberg's films isn't a neutral force that can be erased from our experience of reality. Devices like the teleportation pods in The Fly violently impact and change the body. Technology becomes an extension and intensifier of bodily experience. 

\item \textbf{The Body as Unknowable:} Even as technology transforms and opens up the body, it remains a source of mystery and terror. Cronenberg suggests our culture's relentless attempt to master the body is ultimately doomed, revealing the limits of control. 

\item \textbf{Monstrous Ambivalence:} The monstrous bodily transformations in Cronenberg's films are both horrifying and strangely captivating. He refuses to present a purely negative view of these changes, instead showcasing the instability of the body as a source of both fear and fascination.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connections to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927) and THX 1138 (1971):} Both films feature dystopian societies where technology is used to control and suppress the body. In Metropolis, workers' bodies are reduced to mechanical parts, while in THX 1138, desires and emotions are chemically suppressed. Cronenberg's work echoes this critique but goes further: technology doesn't merely subdue the body, it radically reshapes it, leading to a chaotic and potentially liberating breakdown of control. 

\item \textbf{Solaris (1972):}  Like Cronenberg's films, Solaris explores the limits of the scientific mind in understanding a reality that is deeply entangled with the body and psyche. The sentient planet Solaris creates physical manifestations of the astronauts' repressed desires and memories, much like Cronenberg uses bodily mutations to express psychological states.

\item \textbf{Aliens (1986):}  While predominantly an action film, Aliens shares with Cronenberg a fascination with the visceral horror of the body. The monstrous Xenomorphs violate human bodies in graphic ways, their birth sequences particularly violent and disturbing. Ripley's final power suit is a fusion of human and machine in a monstrous echo of Cronenberg's The Fly.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}

Cronenberg's films expose the dark underside of the often-optimistic technological vision of traditional sci-fi. He reminds us that the body is a vulnerable yet potent site of resistance even in the face of oppressive technology. His work invites us to question our desire for absolute control and explore the monstrous potential that lies dormant within our own flesh.

\subsection{The Eco-material Posthuman in the Age of the Anthropocene}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Eco-Material Posthuman:} This theoretical framework moves away from traditional humanist views of the human as exceptional and separate from nature. It emphasizes a view of the human body as fundamentally material and deeply interconnected with the broader environment. In the context of the Anthropocene, this perspective highlights the impact of human actions on the planet and the vulnerabilities shared across species and ecosystems.

\item \textbf{The Body as Cell:} This reading emphasizes the shared biological building blocks – the cell – that connect humans with all other life forms. In science fiction, this can be used to challenge assumptions of human dominance, blurring the lines between self and other.

\item \textbf{The Body as Affect:} Posthuman theory often views the body as pre-cognitive, with affective responses preceding conscious thought. These bodily states, often influenced by or directly connected to the environment, reveal our entanglement with the material world and undermine the idea of a fully autonomous human subject.  

\item \textbf{The Body as Vital Materiality:} Vital materialism rejects the idea of matter as passive or inert. Instead, it frames matter, including the human body, as possessing agency and a generative life force of its own. This perspective challenges notions of human control and highlights our co-constitutive relationship with the nonhuman world.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Connection to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927):} Fritz Lang's seminal work visually represents the anxieties of a society on the brink of technological upheaval. The film's portrayal of vast machines and dehumanized workers could be reinterpreted through an eco-material posthuman lens. Workers become interchangeable elements within a larger system, their bodies reduced to their material capacity to perform labor, foreshadowing concerns about the body as a mere component in a capitalist machine.

\item \textbf{Godzilla (1954):} The original Godzilla is a product of its era, a response to the nuclear age and the very real devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But it can also be seen as an eco-materialist fable, with Godzilla signifying the agency of the natural world pushed back. Radiation, a force beyond human control, alters the creature's biology (echoing the concept of cellular transmutation) and underscores the material consequences of nuclear weapons.

\item \textbf{Solaris (1972):} Tarkovsky's meditative film explores the limits of human knowledge and understanding, particularly in relation to the nonhuman world. The sentient planet Solaris, resisting all attempts at understanding, can be seen as a manifestation of vital materialism - matter operating by its own logic and indifferent to human desire for control. Contact with Solaris also brings about a breakdown of subjecthood through its ability to materialize memories and trauma, suggesting a permeable relationship between the material body and its external environment.

\item \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):} Ridley Scott's film asks fundamental questions about what it means to be human, exploring the distinctions between humans and their replicant creations. An eco-material lens allows further questioning. The replicants' limited lifespans, their very bodies designed for obsolescence, raise issues about the materiality of existence and the blurring of lines between organic and artificial life.  

\item \textbf{The Fly (1986):}  David Cronenberg's body horror masterpiece delves into the horrific breakdown of the human form through a grotesque hybrid merging of man and insect. This can be seen as an exploration of "trans-corporeality" – the entanglement of human and nonhuman matter – and a blurring between self and other through the cell's susceptibility to change.

\item \textbf{WALL-E (2008):} This animated Pixar film offers a cautionary tale about the Anthropocene and its impact on the Earth. However, within this narrative is the story of a robot left behind to clean up humanity's mess. WALL-E's persistence, his fascination with human artifacts, and his burgeoning sense of self suggest a form of nonhuman agency and a potential for empathy beyond the human species. 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}
The eco-material posthuman perspective offers a framework to analyze science fiction films that grapple with environmental crisis and the changing relationship between humans and nature. By focusing on the body as a site of connection with the nonhuman world, these films can challenge anthropocentrism, explore the implications of the Anthropocene, and envision new ways of understanding our place within a complex and interconnected ecosystem.



\subsection{Animation and Automation, or, the Incredible Effortfulness of Being}
\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Animation and Automation:} Explores how our definitions of "animation" (giving life to the inanimate) and "automation" (replacing human labor with machines) have blurred and shifted over time. \textit{WALL-E}embodies this blurring, being both mechanical and electronic, programmed and seemingly self-aware.

\item \textbf{WALL-E as Transitional Figure:} \textit{WALL-E}bridges our understanding of technology: familiar mechanical labor VS effortless electronic automation. He's also a figure of change himself.  \textit{WALL-E}starts as a simple machine but develops curiosity, adaptability, and even the hints of emotion and desire.

\item \textbf{Preservation of Humanity:} WALL-E's collection of human artifacts and love of old movies sparks hope and nostalgia, suggesting that even in a machine-driven future, the "human idea" might be preserved. This preservation is two-way: humans animated \textit{WALL-E}with their own qualities, and those very qualities become the source of humanity's renewal.

\item \textbf{Redefining Animation \& Life:} Humans in \textit{WALL-E}have become inert, dependent on technology. It's WALL-E, the machine, who embodies effort, movement, and the will to keep going - qualities that become markers of being "alive." This challenges the idea of smooth, computer-driven animation being the pinnacle. The film favors the visible effort of older animation, reminding us of the labor involved in being alive. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5pt}
\textbf{Connection to Studied Films}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metropolis (1927):} Both Metropolis and \textit{WALL-E}explore class division through the lens of automation. Metropolis' workers are dehumanized cogs in a machine; WALL-E's humans are similarly reduced by their dependence on technology.

\item \textbf{The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920):} The distorted, expressionistic world of Caligari reflects a subjective, unreliable reality. WALL-E's use of both old film and new computer animation similarly questions the nature of reality and perception as technology changes.

\item \textbf{THX 1138 (1971):}  Like the sterile, emotionally controlled citizens of THX, humans in \textit{WALL-E}are passive and dehumanized by technology. The rebellion and escape in THX mirrors the breaking free from programmed routines that \textit{WALL-E}sparks.

\item \textbf{Solaris (1972):} Solaris features a mysterious, seemingly sentient entity challenging human understanding. WALL-E, an inanimate machine gaining sentience, evokes a similar question about the boundaries of consciousness.

\item \textbf{Blade Runner (1982):} Both films question what makes someone truly "alive". Is it biology (like Blade Runner's replicants), or is it something more intangible, as \textit{WALL-E}suggests through his actions and emotions?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5pt}

The analysis of \textit{WALL-E}highlights ways science fiction films explore anxieties about technology and what defines humanity. It raises concerns that excessive automation and reliance on seamless spectacle can dull our own life force. However, it also hints at the possibility of machines inheriting aspects of humanity, forcing us to reconsider what "being human" means.

\section{Practice}
\subsection{Technophilia, role of women}
\begin{exercise}
    One Paragraph: In her essay, “Technophilia,” Mary Ann Doane describes a tradition of science fiction that explores technological interventions for idealizing womanhood. Drawing on Doane’s analysis, choose one of the following films and explain, using examples, how a futurist imaginary transforms the category of woman. La Jetée, Metropolis, Solaris, Annihilation, Aliens, THX 1138.

    \textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Option 1}
}

    \textcolor{blue}{
    In Chris Marker's experimental film "La Jetée," the category of woman is deeply transformed by technological interventions that manipulate memory and perception. The film primarily unfolds through still images and narrates the story of a man haunted by the memory of a woman he saw on a pier at Orly Airport as a child. This memory becomes the anchor for his journeys through time, facilitated by a dystopian society's technological experiments in the aftermath of a catastrophic war.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The female protagonist in "La Jetée" is notably nameless, and her existence is confined to the realm of memory and image, specifically a single moment frozen in time. This reduction of the woman to an image serves as a potent form of technological control and idealization. The protagonist's memory of the woman is repeatedly revisited and manipulated, turning her into an object of obsession and a symbol of lost and unattainable beauty. This serves as a critique of the male gaze, where the woman is idealized and objectified through the lens of male desire and memory. The technology in the film not only facilitates this obsession but also literalizes it by making her a fixed point in temporal experiments, suggesting that technology, when combined with male desire, can enforce a static and idealized notion of womanhood, devoid of agency or dynamism.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The film’s exploration of memory as a tool for controlling the image of woman aligns with Doane’s analysis of technology as a means to idealize femininity. In "La Jetée," the woman is essentially a construct of the protagonist's desires, shaped and reshaped by his memories, which are themselves influenced by the technological manipulation of his time-traveling experiences. The technology thus transforms the category of woman into a passive and ever-perfect icon, untouched by the ravages of time and reality, perpetually trapped in a moment of sublime beauty that is both powerful and profoundly limiting.
    }

    \textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Option 2}
}
    
    \textcolor{blue}{
    Fritz Lang’s "Metropolis" features one of the most iconic representations of woman as both a technologically idealized figure and a subject of male control and fear through the creation of the Maschinenmensch, a robotic replica of the film's heroine, Maria. The film juxtaposes the virtuous, human Maria with her artificial double, an entity that embodies the technological ambitions and fears of its era. The robot Maria is crafted by the inventor Rotwang and the master of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen, who intend to use her to manipulate the working class by corrupting their vision of the virtuous human Maria.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The Maschinenmensch symbolizes the ultimate idealized woman in several respects: she is visually perfect, obedient, and devoid of human flaws, representing an unattainable standard of female beauty and compliance. Her creation and deployment illustrate a literal and figurative attempt to mold femininity according to male desires and fears. The robot is a spectacle of fear and desire, inciting lust and violence, disrupting societal order, and ultimately highlighting the destructive consequences of trying to control and perfect nature through technology.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    Mary Ann Doane discusses how technological representations in cinema often reflect cultural anxieties about femininity and the potential for its replication and manipulation. "Metropolis" explores these themes by showing how the robot Maria becomes a source of chaos when she diverges from her creators' intentions. The film critiques the patriarchal desire to control and idealize womanhood, depicted through the disastrous consequences of unleashing a technologically created femme fatale. The artificial Maria's role in the film underscores the problematic aspects of technological interventions in femininity—where the quest for a perfect, controllable woman leads to moral and social upheaval, emphasizing the unnaturalness and danger of such idealized constructs.}

    \textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Option 3}
}
    
    \textcolor{blue}{
    In Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Solaris,” the transformation of the category of woman is vividly portrayed through the character of Hari, who is a replica of the protagonist Kris Kelvin’s late wife. This character is not just a manifestation of Kelvin's memories but an embodiment of his idealized version of Hari. Tarkovsky uses Hari's multiple manifestations to delve deeply into the male psyche, exposing how technology—in this case, the mysterious ocean on the planet Solaris—can be used to recreate and manipulate the feminine ideal to the whims of the male desire.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    One of the most striking scenes illustrating this concept occurs when Hari first appears aboard the space station. The scene is composed with a soft focus that blurs the edges of the frame, symbolizing the unclear boundaries between reality and memory. The camera lingers on Hari’s confused and innocent expressions, which, combined with the eerie silence of the space station, heightens the sense of unnaturalness surrounding her existence. The slow, deliberate pacing of the scene allows the audience to perceive Hari as both a ghostly presence and a tangible entity, reflecting Kelvin's conflicting emotions of desire and fear towards this re-creation of his wife.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    In a later scene, Hari attempts suicide only to regenerate rapidly, demonstrating her artificial nature. This sequence employs abrupt cuts and a chaotic montage that contrasts sharply with the earlier, more serene presentations of Hari. This editing style conveys the jarring realization for both Kelvin and the audience that Hari, despite her appearance and emotions, is not truly human. This moment is pivotal as it foregrounds the ethical and existential dilemmas faced by Kelvin, making the audience question the morality of using technology to resurrect the dead as idealized forms devoid of their original human complexities.}    
    
    \textcolor{blue}{
    Hari’s character development throughout the film uses the cinematic space and mise-en-scène to emphasize her transformation from a mere memory to an individual entity struggling with her own existence. The use of mirrors and reflective surfaces in several scenes symbolizes her introspective quest for identity and existence beyond Kelvin's perceptions. This not only challenges but also tragically underscores her inability to ever be more than a product of Kelvin’s memories, manipulated by the alien technology of Solaris.
    }

    \textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Option 4}
}
    
    \textcolor{blue}{
    "Annihilation" by Alex Garland explores the transformation of the female form in a much more radical and visceral manner. The film presents a group of women who enter a mysterious zone called the Shimmer, where the laws of nature are distorted by an alien presence. This environment acts as a catalyst for profound physical and psychological changes, challenging the traditional notions of femininity and human identity.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    Garland uses vibrant colors and a continuous, fluid camera movement to represent the Shimmer’s effect on the women. The use of iridescent hues and a soft focus lens on the flora and fauna create a dream-like quality that mirrors the characters' transformations. In one key sequence, the character of Josie voluntarily allows her body to be overtaken by the alien flora, turning into a humanoid garden. This scene is shot with wide angles and a slow pan to emphasize her acceptance and integration into the environment, contrasting with the more claustrophobic, rapid-fire editing of the scenes depicting fear and confusion.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The protagonist, Lena, faces her duplicate in the climax, which is a scene rich with symbolic imagery. The mirroring effect created by having Lena and her doppelgänger mimic each other’s movements in a bizarre dance underscores the theme of self-confrontation and transformation. The use of echoing sound design and mirrored choreography highlights the blurring lines between the original and the copy, questioning the very essence of identity and self.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    Moreover, the film’s final scenes, where Lena’s eyes shimmer with the alien color, suggest that her transformation is both internal and irreversible. The subtle use of CGI to alter the eye’s appearance, combined with Natalie Portman’s restrained but intense performance, leaves the audience questioning what humanity remains if any.}

    \textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Option 5}
}
    
    \textcolor{blue}{
    Aliens elevates the character of Ellen Ripley from survivor to warrior, redefining the feminine hero archetype in a manner that's both groundbreaking and deeply influential within the science fiction genre. James Cameron's sequel to the Ridley Scott horror classic shifts from horror to an action-driven narrative, employing a variety of film techniques to enhance its thematic depth and highlight Ripley’s transformation.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The visual aesthetics of Aliens play a crucial role in subverting traditional gender roles. Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, is initially presented in a vulnerable state, recovering from her traumatic experience in the first film. However, Cameron quickly transitions her from vulnerability to empowerment. This transformation is visually emphasized in scenes where Ripley takes control of the Colonial Marines' weaponry and equipment. One key scene is her use of the power loader; Cameron uses a low-angle shot that captures Ripley stepping into the loader, symbolically stepping into a position of power and agency, directly challenging the previously male-dominated realm of physical combat.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    Cameron’s use of close-ups on Ripley during critical moments—such as her confrontation with the Alien Queen—serves to focus on her emotional resilience and strategic thinking. These close-ups are juxtaposed with shots of the chaotic environment and the frenzied actions of the male marines, highlighting Ripley's calm and collected demeanor in contrast to her male counterparts, thus redefining the notion of heroism as not just physical bravery but also mental toughness.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The film’s sound design also complements Ripley’s character development. The intense, rhythmic pulse of the score during action sequences mirrors Ripley's heartbeat, drawing the audience into her emotional state, creating a visceral connection that emphasizes her role as the central hero. Furthermore, the diegetic sounds of the aliens contrast sharply with the technological sounds of the human environment, emphasizing the alien threat and Ripley's courage as she navigates this hostile landscape.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    In summary, Aliens uses a blend of cinematography, sound design, and narrative structure to transform the character of Ripley into a symbol of female empowerment. This reimagining of the action hero through the lens of a female protagonist challenges and expands the conventions of the science fiction genre, providing a complex portrayal of womanhood that is both powerful and inspiring.
    }

    \textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Option 6}
}
    
    \textcolor{blue}{
    THX 1138, George Lucas’s directorial debut, presents a dystopian future where technology infiltrates every aspect of human life, including the suppression of gender distinctions and the eradication of individuality. The film employs a minimalist aesthetic and stark cinematographic techniques to explore themes of control, conformity, and the loss of personal identity.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The visual style of THX 1138 is characterized by its use of white, sterile environments that dominate the film’s setting. This color scheme not only reflects the clinical nature of the society but also visually represents the erasure of individuality—including gender identity. Lucas uses wide shots of the characters moving through vast, impersonal spaces to emphasize their insignificance and the overwhelming power of the technological system that controls them. The uniformity in the characters’ appearance, with shaved heads and identical white clothing, visually strips away any markers of gender, reducing characters to mere components of the societal machine.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    Sound plays a critical role in reinforcing the film's themes. The omnipresent background noise of computerized voices and mechanical sounds creates a sense of constant surveillance and control. This is complemented by the sparse dialogue, which is often delivered in a monotone, further dehumanizing the characters and erasing emotional and gender distinctions. Lucas particularly focuses on the sound design to enhance the sense of a controlled environment where even speech is regulated and devoid of personal expression.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    The film’s editing also contributes to its thematic concerns. Lucas employs a cold, mechanical pacing, with scenes transitioning smoothly to mimic the characters' regulated lives. The lack of abrupt cuts reflects the unending, monotonous existence of the characters, trapped in a loop of conformity. This editing style is punctuated by moments of frantic, chaotic sequences—such as THX’s escape attempt—highlighting moments of rebellion against the oppressive order.}
    
        \textcolor{blue}{
    THX 1138 uses these film techniques to craft a narrative that is as much about the suppression of gender and the human spirit as it is about the broader implications of technological domination. The aesthetic choices—visual, auditory, and narrative—serve to create a chilling vision of a future where technology has stripped humanity not just of individuality but also of gender, leaving behind a homogenized, controlled population that serves as a warning against the unchecked expansion of technological control in society.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Anthropocene}
\begin{exercise}
    Three Paragraphs: Many science fiction films represent the relationship between humans and non-humans in the “Anthropocene.” Choose from two of the following films: Godzilla, La Jetée, The Fly, Annihilation, WALL-E. Write three paragraphs in the following order.

- Paragraph 1: explain, using examples, how Film 1 represents an “Anthropocene.”

- Paragraph 2: explain, using examples, how Film 2 represents an “Anthropocene.”

- Paragraph 3: compare and contrast both films’ representations of an “Anthropocene”

\textbf{Option 1}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Godzilla} symbolizes the catastrophic impact of human actions on the environment, marking a significant representation of the Anthropocene era. The film employs a combination of special effects and narrative to emphasize Godzilla as a byproduct of nuclear testing—an unintended and uncontrollable force born from humanity's technological hubris. His immense size and power are captured through low-angle shots that tower over the urban landscape, symbolizing the massive scale of human environmental impact. Scenes of Godzilla rampaging through Tokyo, crushing buildings and creating chaos, visually illustrate the disruptive consequences of human actions on the natural order. The film's use of haunting soundscapes and eerie silence prior to Godzilla’s appearances enhances the ominous tone, underscoring the dread and fear associated with environmental disasters.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Annihilation}, in contrast, portrays the Anthropocene through the surreal and mutating landscape of the Shimmer. This film uses vivid color palettes and fluid, morphing visual effects to depict the integration and mutation of DNA across species barriers. The Shimmer's environment, where flowers mimic human shapes and animals blend with plants, serves as a metaphor for the Anthropocene's deep, irreversible intertwining of human activity with the natural world. Cinematographically, Annihilation employs soft focus and a saturated color scheme to blur the lines between the natural and unnatural, enhancing the sense of alienation from the familiar. The psychological disorientation experienced by the characters is mirrored in the disorienting narrative structure and pacing of the film, reflecting the complex, often incomprehensible consequences of human environmental interference.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	Comparatively, \textbf{Godzilla} and \textbf{Annihilation} offer distinct visions of the Anthropocene. \textbf{Godzilla} externalizes the Anthropocene as a monstrous other, a direct result of nuclear technology that reflects on the overt dangers of human overreach. Its narrative focuses on the clash between human civilization and a titanic force, emphasizing a battle to regain control or at least mitigate disaster. \textbf{Annihilation}, however, internalizes the Anthropocene, presenting a world where the very essence of life is uncontrollably altered from within. It suggests that the Anthropocene could lead to a profound transformation of both the environment and human identity, visualized through the film's intricate mutations and the characters' existential struggles. While both films depict catastrophic scenarios, they differ in their portrayal of threat—the former as an assault on human cities, the latter as an insidious alteration of biological reality. Together, they encapsulate the dual aspects of the Anthropocene: destruction and transformation, external threat and internal change.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 2}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{The Fly} offers a visceral depiction of the Anthropocene, portraying the individual body as a battleground for nature and technology. David Cronenberg utilizes grotesque body horror elements to symbolize the invasive impact of technology on the natural order. Seth Brundle's transformation, triggered by a teleportation experiment that goes awry, is a graphic representation of human intervention into natural processes. The film employs close-ups and detailed practical effects to capture the horrifying metamorphosis of Brundle's body, emphasizing the theme of internal contamination. This transformation is both literal and metaphorical, reflecting the broader environmental and ethical concerns of the Anthropocene. His gradual loss of humanity—visually emphasized through the progressive grotesqueness of his physical change—serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of manipulating nature.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{WALL-E}, directed by Andrew Stanton, contrasts with \textit{The Fly} by focusing on ecological rather than bodily decay. Set on a future Earth overwhelmed by waste, the film uses wide, lingering shots of vast landscapes filled with garbage to highlight the planet's drastic alteration due to human consumerism. WALL-E, the lone waste-collecting robot, is depicted through warm, soft-focus close-ups that imbue him with a sympathetic, almost human quality, contrasting sharply with the cold, desolate settings. This visual contrast reinforces the film's theme of hope and resilience in the face of environmental catastrophe. The discovery of a single growing plant is framed as a significant, hopeful moment, shot in vibrant color to stand out starkly against the dull grays and browns of Earth’s landscape, symbolizing the potential for renewal and change.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	While both \textbf{The Fly} and \textbf{WALL-E} address themes central to the Anthropocene, they do so through distinct narrative and aesthetic lenses. \textbf{The Fly} focuses on the horrors of personal physical transformation as a metaphor for environmental intervention gone awry, using body horror to explore the fears associated with biotechnological advancements. In contrast, \textbf{WALL-E} presents a broader, more societal examination of the Anthropocene, critiquing the long-term impacts of human activity on the planet. It combines elements of a dystopian future with a narrative of redemption and recovery, offering a critique mixed with optimism. Both films, therefore, provide compelling insights into the Anthropocene, highlighting the profound and often disturbing implications of humanity's footprint on the world, but through vastly different scopes—personal versus planetary.
}


\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 3}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{La Jetée} portrays a post-apocalyptic Anthropocene, capturing the desolation of a world ravaged by global conflict, leaving Earth uninhabitable and humanity forced underground. The film employs a unique narrative technique, using predominantly still images alongside a poignant voiceover, creating a reflective and melancholic atmosphere. This choice accentuates the theme of memory and loss, with the still images serving as frozen moments in time, echoing the stasis and regression of human society. The stark black and white photography enhances the bleakness of their situation, symbolizing a world stripped of vitality. The narrative's focus on time travel as a desperate attempt to escape or amend their current state underscores a thematic concern with humanity's ongoing struggle against the consequences of its own actions, emphasizing a cyclical pattern of environmental and ethical crises.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	In contrast, \textbf{WALL-E} presents a more contemporary vision of the Anthropocene, characterized by consumer excess and environmental negligence. The film uses vibrant animation and dynamic cinematography to depict Earth as a garbage-laden wasteland juxtaposed against the technologically advanced but sterile life aboard the Axiom spaceship. This visual contrast not only highlights the degradation of Earth but also critiques the unsustainable consumer culture that led to such devastation. The character of WALL-E, animated with expressive movements and sounds, personifies the persistence of life and the possibility of renewal amidst ruin. The film's narrative, focusing on recovery and the rediscovery of plant life, injects a sense of hope, suggesting that redemption is possible through responsible stewardship and reconnecting with the natural world.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	Both \textbf{La Jetée} and \textbf{WALL-E} explore the Anthropocene from different perspectives but converge on similar themes of environmental and existential crisis. \textbf{La Jetée} adopts a somber tone to reflect on the consequences of human folly and the haunting permanence of environmental damage, using the medium of still photography to emphasize the static and irreversible nature of their dystopian reality. \textbf{WALL-E}, however, offers a more accessible critique through its satirical depiction of consumerism and its optimistic outlook on human capacity for change. While \textbf{La Jetée} dwells on the melancholic aspects of human impact on the environment, \textbf{WALL-E} provides a more balanced view by showcasing both the deep-seated issues and the potential for significant positive change. Both films, through their distinct aesthetic and narrative choices, compellingly address the urgency of reevaluating our relationship with the planet within the context of the Anthropocene.
}
\end{exercise}



\subsection{Closeups}
\begin{exercise}
    One Paragraph. Close-ups and extreme close-ups each give us specific information about a cinematic world and create particular relationships between the viewer’s body and the screen body. Choose one of either Godzilla or THX 1138 and explain, using examples, the motivation behind the use of close-ups or extreme close-ups in the film.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 1}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	In George Lucas's "THX 1138," the use of close-ups and extreme close-ups is pivotal in conveying the oppressive atmosphere of the film's dystopian setting. These techniques are strategically employed to intensify the viewer's experience of surveillance and control, core themes of the narrative. Extreme close-ups are frequently used to focus on characters' eyes and mouths, isolating these features from the rest of the face and body. This not only dehumanizes the characters, reducing them to the sum of their parts, but also echoes the pervasive surveillance technology within the society. For example, scenes where the protagonist THX is monitored by robotic policemen are shot in extreme close-up, highlighting his eyes to reflect his fear and paranoia, and to create a suffocating sense of being constantly watched. These close-ups serve a dual purpose: they emphasize the sterile, impersonal nature of this society, where individuals are constantly observed and controlled, and they also allow for an intimate connection between the audience and the characters, making the viewer feel the characters' claustrophobia and despair. This visual technique mirrors the film's thematic exploration of a society where privacy is invaded and individuality is crushed, effectively drawing the viewer into the emotional and psychological turmoil experienced by the characters.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 2}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	In "Godzilla," the strategic use of close-ups and extreme close-ups serves to heighten the dramatic tension and underscore the monumental scale of Godzilla as a symbol of catastrophic natural forces. These cinematographic techniques focus intensively on Godzilla's features, such as his eyes, teeth, and scales, enhancing the creature's menacing presence and the visceral impact on the audience. For instance, extreme close-ups of Godzilla's eyes convey a piercing look that suggests intelligence and malevolence, instilling a deeper sense of fear and awe. Similarly, close-ups on his massive, destructive claws and the rough texture of his skin emphasize his brute strength and the sheer enormity of his being. In contrast, close-ups on human characters during scenes of chaos and destruction highlight their emotional reactions—fear, panic, and sometimes resignation—thus underscoring their fragility and helplessness in the face of such overwhelming power. This juxtaposition not only magnifies the disparity between human capabilities and Godzilla's might but also visually reinforces the film's exploration of themes such as the consequences of humanity's hubris and the existential threat posed by human-induced environmental disasters. By bringing viewers into a close, almost claustrophobic engagement with both Godzilla and the human characters, the film creates a compelling narrative tension that emphasizes the profound impact of Godzilla on the human world.

\subsection{Postmodernity}
\begin{exercise}
    Two Paragraphs: “Postmodernity” describes both a set of aesthetic trends and a series of conceptual shifts in how we understand subjectivity and reality. Choosing two films from the syllabus, write two paragraphs in the following order.

- Paragraph 1: Describe Film 1’s aesthetic and conceptual signs of postmodern thought

- Paragraph 2: Describe Film 2’s aesthetic and conceptual signs of postmodern thought

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 1}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} exemplifies postmodern aesthetics through its eclectic fusion of visual styles and architectural influences, creating a multifaceted and texturally rich urban landscape that reflects the complexity and plurality of postmodern society. The film’s use of neon-lit signage alongside retrofitted classical architecture underpins its pastiche approach, blending the old with the new to suggest a temporal dislocation. Conceptually, \textbf{Blade Runner} interrogates the nature of reality and identity through its narrative of replicants who challenge the authenticity of human experience. The replicants, especially Rachel, who possesses implanted memories, blur the lines between human and machine, questioning the constructs of identity and self-awareness. The film’s neo-noir elements, such as the morally ambiguous protagonist and the pervasive sense of urban decay, enhance its exploration of postmodern themes such as alienation and the fragmentation of identity. The ambiguous conclusion, leaving viewers questioning the nature of Deckard’s own existence, further exemplifies postmodern skepticism towards grand narratives and objective truths, encapsulating a world where appearances are inherently unreliable.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{WALL-E}, while primarily an animated children’s film, incorporates postmodern aesthetics by blending homage and critique, particularly through its engagement with past cinematic forms and its satirical take on consumer culture. The film evokes a nostalgic sense of the past through its references to early silent films and classic Hollywood narratives, using these intertextual elements to craft a narrative that is both familiar and new. The use of CGI in \textbf{WALL-E} creates hyper-real environments that blur the line between animation and live action, challenging perceptions of what is real—a key postmodern concern. On a conceptual level, the film engages with themes of hyperreality and simulation, particularly through the depiction of humans living in a mediated, consumption-driven environment aboard the Axiom spaceship, detached from natural experiences. This critique of advanced capitalist society reflects postmodern concerns about the commodification of life and the erosion of authentic human experiences. Additionally, the film’s ecological message interrogates the modernist narrative of endless progress, suggesting a need to reevaluate our relationship with technology and the environment in a postmodern world increasingly characterized by ecological and existential uncertainty.
}


\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 2}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Metropolis}, Fritz Lang's seminal work, demonstrates early postmodern tendencies through its visual style and thematic complexity. The film employs German Expressionist techniques, characterized by exaggerated sets and stark, dramatic contrasts in lighting, which create a surreal, dystopian cityscape that seems both futuristic and otherworldly. This stylization produces a heightened sense of artificiality, blurring the lines between reality and fiction—a key postmodern trait. Thematically, \textbf{Metropolis} critiques the grand narrative of industrial progress by depicting a society where technological advancement results in stark social divisions and human alienation. The creation of the Maschinenmensch, a robotic double of Maria, introduces themes of replication and the interchangeability of reality with simulation, challenging the concept of a stable, authentic identity and foreseeing future postmodern concerns with simulacra and the dissolution of the human subject in the face of technological domination.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Neptune Frost} by Saul Williams and Anisia Uzeyman is a vibrant embodiment of postmodern aesthetics through its Afrofuturist approach, merging the traditional with the technological in a striking critique of contemporary global issues. The film's use of eclectic costumes made from recycled materials and its hybrid musical landscape that fuses electronic with traditional African rhythms exemplify a quintessentially postmodern bricolage. Visually and sonically, the film disrupts conventional narrative forms and cultural expectations, creating a collage that defies genre categorization. Conceptually, \textbf{Neptune Frost} questions the binary distinctions between human and machine, and between the Global North and South, suggesting a fluid, interconnected world where identity is multiple and mutable. The film’s narrative explores themes of decentralization and resistance against oppressive power structures, reflecting postmodern skepticism of meta-narratives and emphasizing a pluralistic, inclusive view of the future that embraces difference rather than conformity.
}


\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Option 3}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{2001: A Space Odyssey}, directed by Stanley Kubrick, embodies postmodern aesthetics through its innovative use of visual and narrative techniques. The film’s aesthetic minimalism is expressed in its clean, geometric set designs and the extensive use of open, empty spaces that evoke a sense of isolation and alienation. These elements, combined with the film’s deliberate pacing and the iconic, haunting score, create a cinematic experience that prioritizes form and ambiguity over traditional narrative clarity. Conceptually, \textbf{2001} challenges the Enlightenment narrative of human progress and dominance through its portrayal of HAL 9000, a sentient computer whose eventual malfunction poses existential questions about the relationship between creators and their creations. The film’s open-ended conclusion, leaving many questions unanswered and inviting multiple interpretations, is quintessentially postmodern, as it undermines the possibility of a single, unifying truth and emphasizes the instability of human knowledge.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Annihilation}, directed by Alex Garland, showcases postmodern themes through its exploration of hybridity, identity, and the collapse of environmental and biological boundaries. The film employs a fragmented narrative structure that mirrors the disintegration of the characters’ identities and the world around them. This narrative fragmentation is reflected visually in the film’s lush, surreal imagery within the Shimmer, where genetic material is freely exchanged between species, resulting in bizarre and beautiful mutations. These visual motifs challenge traditional categories of species and identity, emphasizing postmodern themes of ambiguity and transformation. Furthermore, \textbf{Annihilation} engages with contemporary environmental concerns, presenting a postmodern critique of the grand narrative of technological control over nature. The film suggests that such attempts at control are not only futile but also potentially catastrophic, aligning with postmodern skepticism towards human-centered narratives of progress.
}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Technophobia}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Explore the theme of "Technophobia" using examples from either \textit{Blade Runner} or \textit{The Fly}. Discuss how the film uses narrative and visual elements to convey anxieties about technological advancement and its impact on human identity. Consider aspects such as character development, mise-en-scène, and special effects to support your analysis.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} vividly encapsulates technophobia through its depiction of a future where human-like androids, known as replicants, challenge the very essence of human identity. The film utilizes its narrative and rich visual tapestry to foreground deep-seated anxieties about technological advancements and their implications for humanity. The character development of the replicants, particularly Rachael and Roy Batty, serves as a central element in exploring these fears. Rachael's struggle with her own memories, initially believed to be genuine but later revealed as implants, raises profound questions about the authenticity of human experience itself. Roy’s eloquent monologue towards the film's climax further humanizes the replicants, juxtaposing their emotional depth against the humans who appear cold and detached. The mise-en-scène reinforces this anxiety; the dark, rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles, combined with the omnipresent neon lights, create a dystopian world where technology permeates every aspect of life, suggesting a future dominated by technological constructs at the expense of natural human existence. Special effects, such as the eerie glow of the replicants’ eyes, subtly cue viewers to the artificiality lurking beneath the surface of human semblances, further blurring the lines between human and machine. Through these elements, \textit{Blade Runner} not only reflects technophobic fears but also prompts a deeper reflection on what it means to be human in a technologically advanced world.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{The Fly} by David Cronenberg masterfully explores technophobia through the horrific transformation of its protagonist, Seth Brundle, after an experiment with a teleportation device goes tragically wrong. The film uses both narrative and visual elements to express deep anxieties about the merging of human flesh with technology. Seth's initial transformation showcases the wonders of scientific discovery, yet quickly devolves into a grotesque and cautionary tale about the dangers of overreaching technological ambition. Character development is central to the film's exploration of technophobia, as viewers witness Seth's metamorphosis from a brilliant and enthusiastic scientist into a monstrous hybrid of man and insect. This transformation is vividly realized through the film's groundbreaking use of makeup and special effects, which visually manifest the physical corruption brought by technological interference. The mise-en-scène in Seth’s apartment-turned-laboratory, cluttered with the detritus of his experiments, becomes a physical representation of the chaos that the unchecked use of technology can wreak on the human body and spirit. Through these elements, \textit{The Fly} not only showcases the physical horrors that technology can inflict but also metaphorically questions the ethical and existential risks of altering the natural order.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Sublime}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. The concept of the "Sublime" is often explored in science fiction films through overwhelming visual aesthetics or themes that challenge human understanding. Choose one scene from either \textit{2001: A Space Odyssey} or \textit{Annihilation} and analyze how the film creates a sense of the sublime. Focus on cinematographic techniques, sound design, and the ways these elements combine to evoke awe and possibly terror in the audience.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	The "Star Gate" sequence in \textbf{2001: A Space Odyssey} is a quintessential exploration of the sublime, effectively capturing the overwhelming and awe-inspiring possibilities of space travel and the unknown. In this sequence, the convergence of visual effects, cinematography, and sound design masterfully evokes a sense of cosmic wonder and existential dread. The use of slit-scan photography creates a continuous, flowing tunnel of vibrant, abstract patterns that engulf the protagonist, Dave, and the viewers, pulling both into a visually disorienting journey. This effect, combined with the eerie, atonal music and the sudden, fleeting images of strange, alien landscapes, intensifies the feeling of venturing into the unknown—a journey not just through space but across dimensions. The sequence’s prolonged duration and the slow movement of the camera further add to the sublime nature of the scene, underscoring the vastness and the incomprehensible scale of the universe. Through these elements, Kubrick not only pushes the boundaries of cinematic technique but also encapsulates the philosophical essence of the sublime, confronting the audience with the boundless mysteries of existence beyond the familiar confines of Earth.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	The lighthouse scene towards the end of \textbf{Annihilation} exemplifies the sublime by visually and thematically confronting the characters—and the audience—with the inexplicable and overwhelming forces of nature transformed by the Shimmer. This sequence uses striking cinematographic techniques, combining unsettling, surreal visuals with a haunting sound design to evoke a profound sense of otherworldly beauty and horror. As Lena approaches and eventually enters the lighthouse, which stands as a mysterious and almost mythical structure amidst the mutated landscape, the use of sharp contrasts in lighting highlights the alien nature of the environment. Inside, the mirrored entity Lena encounters presents a disorienting dance of identity and self-reflection, enhanced by the eerie, droning soundtrack that crescendos into a chaotic symphony, mirroring the psychological and existential turmoil faced by the protagonist. The visual distortion and manipulation of both the environment and the characters within this scene challenge the viewer's understanding of reality and identity, key aspects of the sublime, by presenting a scenario where the natural laws as known by humanity no longer apply. Through this, \textit{Annihilation} not only explores the limits of human comprehension but also illustrates the terror and awe inherent in confronting the vast, unknowable forces of a universe that defies human mastery.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Posthumanism}
\begin{exercise}
	Two Paragraphs. Discuss the portrayal of "Posthuman" themes in either \textit{Solaris} or \textit{WALL-E}. In the first paragraph, describe how the film represents posthuman elements through its characters or setting. In the second paragraph, analyze the implications of these representations for our understanding of human identity and technological interaction. Use specific examples from the film to highlight how narrative and visual strategies contribute to the development of these themes.

\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textbf{Solaris}, posthuman themes are explored through the interactions between the human characters and the mysterious, seemingly sentient ocean of the planet Solaris. This ocean has the ability to materialize human thoughts and memories into physical, responsive beings called "visitors." For example, the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, faces a physical reincarnation of his late wife, Hari, who is both a product of his memories and an independent entity with her own emotions and consciousness. The setting aboard the space station, surrounded by the vast, uncomprehending ocean, serves as a metaphor for the exploration of the human psyche and the limits of human understanding, emphasizing the interplay between human cognition and a potentially posthuman consciousness.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	The implications of these encounters in \textbf{Solaris} challenge our conventional views on identity and human interaction. Hari's presence questions the boundaries of individuality and autonomy, as she exists both as a part of Kelvin's memories and as an autonomous being. This duality forces a reevaluation of what it means to be human when human consciousness can be externalized and given independent form. The film uses subtle visual cues, such as the ethereal lighting around Hari and the often claustrophobic settings of the space station, to enhance the sense of alienation and existential questioning. These elements underscore the profound implications of technological advancements that can replicate or manipulate human consciousness, suggesting a future where the definition of being human might be irreversibly transformed.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textbf{WALL-E}, posthuman themes are predominantly conveyed through the character of WALL-E himself, a waste-collecting robot who exhibits distinctly human characteristics, such as curiosity, affection, and loneliness. The setting—a deserted, garbage-laden Earth—contrasts sharply with the sleek technology of the Axiom spaceship, where humans have evolved into passive consumers who are disconnected from their physical environments. WALL-E’s interactions with various objects and his deep attachment to a recording of "Hello, Dolly!" signify his transcendence beyond his initial programming, pointing to a posthuman blend of technology and human emotion.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	The depiction of humans in \textbf{WALL-E} further explores posthuman themes, particularly through their dependency on technology that has rendered them almost immobile and largely incapable of independent living. This dependency raises critical questions about the evolution of humans in symbiosis with technology, suggesting a future where technology takes on nurturing and sustaining roles traditionally associated with humanity. Visually, the film juxtaposes the vibrant, life-like robots against the more static and lethargic humans, reversing expected roles and highlighting the irony of technological caretaking. This role reversal not only challenges our understanding of human agency and autonomy but also provocatively suggests that the essence of humanity might eventually be preserved and manifested through non-human entities.
}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Environmental catastrophe}
\begin{exercise}
	Two Paragraphs. Consider the theme of "Environmental Catastrophe" as depicted in \textit{WALL-E}. In the first paragraph, describe how the film visualizes the impact of human consumption and waste on the planet. In the second paragraph, analyze how WALL-E's interactions with his environment and the remnants of human technology serve as a critique of contemporary environmental issues.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{WALL-E} presents a stark visualization of environmental catastrophe brought on by excessive human consumption and waste. The film opens with sweeping shots of a deserted, dilapidated Earth, covered in towering skyscrapers of compacted trash and surrounded by a murky, uninviting haze. This apocalyptic landscape is depicted through the use of muted colors and a vast, empty horizon that stretches endlessly, emphasizing the bleakness and abandonment of the planet. The remnants of human civilization are littered throughout, from endless rows of derelict buildings to the ubiquitous advertisements for the Buy-N-Large corporation, underscoring the consumerist behavior that led to the planet's downfall. These visual elements powerfully convey the long-term impacts of unchecked consumerism and environmental neglect, showcasing a planet overwhelmed by garbage, where the natural world has all but vanished beneath layers of human-made waste.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	WALL-E's interactions with his environment further serve as a poignant critique of these contemporary environmental issues. Despite his programming as a waste allocation robot, WALL-E exhibits a curiosity and reverence for nature that contrasts sharply with the behaviors that led to Earth's devastation. His collection of human artifacts, ranging from a spork to a diamond ring, highlights the absurdity and arbitrariness of what humans value. Additionally, WALL-E’s care for a small plant, which he protects and nourishes throughout the film, symbolizes a flicker of hope and the possibility of renewal. This plant becomes a critical element in the plot, representing the potential for Earth's recovery and the importance of preserving and valuing natural life over material possessions. Through WALL-E’s gentle, almost childlike fascination with these simple joys and his role in safeguarding the last remnants of natural life, the film critiques modern society’s disconnection from the environment and underscores the urgent need for a greater awareness and appreciation of our planet’s health.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Simulacrum}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Using examples from either \textit{Blade Runner} or \textit{Solaris}, discuss how the concept of "Simulacrum" is explored within the film. Analyze how the film uses narrative elements, visual techniques, and character development to convey the implications of living in a world where the distinction between reality and simulation becomes increasingly blurred. Consider how these elements contribute to the film’s overall message about the nature of reality and human perception.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} masterfully explores the concept of simulacrum through its narrative focus on replicants—bioengineered beings that are virtually indistinguishable from humans. The film utilizes advanced visual effects and meticulous production design to create a future Los Angeles that itself feels like a simulacrum, blending elements of different cultural and architectural styles to form a hyperreal urban environment. This setting reflects the blurred lines between reality and artificiality, mirroring the existential dilemmas faced by the replicants. Characters such as Rachael and Roy Batty challenge the protagonists' and audience’s perceptions of what is real by exhibiting emotions and memories, questioning the nature of authenticity. Rachael’s discovery that her memories are implants—manufactured experiences designed to provide an emotional cushion—highlights the theme of simulacrum, emphasizing the constructed nature of identity in this dystopian world. Through these elements, \textit{Blade Runner} portrays a deeply layered vision of reality, where the ability to replicate human life both technologically and emotionally calls into question the very essence of human experience and authenticity.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textbf{Solaris}, the concept of simulacrum is central to the film's exploration of memory and identity. The sentient ocean of the planet Solaris has the mysterious ability to materialize physical manifestations of human subconscious desires and memories, creating human-like figures that are not mere illusions but are fully interactive and seemingly autonomous entities. The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, confronts a simulacrum of his late wife, Hari, who embodies both the physical appearance and the emotional depth of the real person he once loved. The film uses subdued color palettes and reflective surfaces throughout the space station to enhance the ethereal and dream-like quality of these encounters, emphasizing the thin veil between reality and the artificial. These manifestations challenge the characters' understanding of reality, as they are forced to interact with beings who are both there and not there—visually and tactilely present but fundamentally unreal. Through this narrative and visual strategy, \textit{Solaris} delves into the psychological and emotional impact of living in a world where the lines between reality and simulation are not just blurred but intertwined, raising profound questions about the nature of human connection and the reliability of perception.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Control vs. Disciplinary society}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze the portrayal of "Control Society and Disciplinary Society" in \textit{THX 1138}. Discuss how the film uses narrative techniques, visual styles, and the depiction of space and surveillance to convey the dynamics of control and discipline in a futuristic society. Examine how these elements reflect or critique contemporary social and political structures, and consider the implications for individual autonomy and freedom.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{THX 1138} provides a stark portrayal of a control society and a disciplinary society through its depiction of a dystopian future where human emotions and behaviors are strictly regulated by a totalitarian regime. The film employs a minimalist aesthetic characterized by stark, white, and sterile environments that visually represent the suppression of individuality and emotion. This visual style is complemented by the omnipresent use of surveillance cameras and monitors, which constantly display the activities of the citizens, reinforcing the theme of surveillance and control. The narrative emphasizes the dehumanization of individuals through the mandatory use of drugs to suppress emotions and maintain compliance, highlighting the mechanisms of control that strip individuals of their autonomy.
	The architectural design of the spaces in \textit{THX 1138}—vast, impersonal, and overwhelmingly white—serves to emphasize the isolation and alienation of the individuals within the society. These spaces are devoid of personal touches and are often framed to include surveillance devices, underscoring the constant monitoring and the panoptic nature of control in the society. The film's portrayal of characters who attempt to resist or escape from this controlled environment underscores the struggle for personal freedom and autonomy. The oppressive control mechanisms visually and narratively critique contemporary social and political structures, suggesting a cautionary tale about the potential future of our own society if surveillance and control continue to expand. The film ultimately raises critical questions about the balance between security and freedom, and the cost of maintaining order at the expense of individual liberty.
}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Images of wonder, conventions of scifi}
\begin{exercise}
	Three Paragraphs. Discuss the portrayal of "Images of Wonder" and the "Grotesque" in science fiction films, comparing and contrasting their use and implications in any two films from the syllabus. 
	
	In the first paragraph, analyze how one film uses "Images of Wonder" to enhance its thematic and visual narrative. 
	
	In the second paragraph, explore how another film employs elements of the "Grotesque" to convey its themes and impact the audience.
	
	 In the third optional paragraph, offer a comparative analysis of how these aesthetic choices influence the viewer's perception and understanding of the film's central messages.
	 
\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textbf{2001: A Space Odyssey}, Stanley Kubrick masterfully employs "Images of Wonder" to delve into themes of human evolution, technology, and the unknown. The film's depiction of space travel and the monolithic structures discovered by humanity evoke a profound sense of wonder and awe. Notably, the sequence featuring the discovery of the monolith on the moon and the subsequent journey to Jupiter incorporates grandiose visual effects and meticulous compositions that emphasize the vastness and majesty of space. These visuals are complemented by the iconic score, which adds a layer of profundity and transcendence. The "Star Gate" sequence, with its surreal, colorful displays of cosmic phenomena, particularly stands out as an embodiment of wonder, pushing the boundaries of human perception and understanding. This scene challenges the viewer to contemplate humanity's place in the universe, encouraging a reevaluation of our technological achievements and philosophical explorations.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	Conversely, David Cronenberg’s \textbf{The Fly} explores the "Grotesque" through the physical and psychological transformation of its protagonist, Seth Brundle, after an experiment with teleportation goes disastrously wrong. Cronenberg uses unsettling visual effects to depict Seth's gradual metamorphosis into a hybrid creature, which is both horrifying and pitiful. The transformation scenes are graphic and detailed, emphasizing the corruption and breakdown of Seth's human form. These grotesque elements not only serve to horrify the viewer but also to symbolize the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition and the fragility of the human body. The climax, where Seth fully transforms into the grotesque "Brundlefly," powerfully conveys the themes of loss, mutation, and the intersection of technology with organic life, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer’s perception of the potential consequences of scientific hubris.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	Comparatively, while both films utilize their chosen aesthetics to enhance their narrative and impact, they do so with markedly different intentions and effects. "Images of Wonder" in \textbf{2001: A Space Odyssey} elevate the viewer’s experience by instilling a sense of curiosity and philosophical introspection about the broader universe, while the "Grotesque" in \textbf{The Fly} confronts viewers with the immediate, visceral realities of scientific experimentation gone awry. Together, these films illustrate how science fiction can oscillate between elevating human perspective to cosmic scales and dragging it into the disturbing depths of bodily disintegration, each compelling in its own right and leaving indelible marks on the viewer's understanding of human potential and peril.
}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Afrofuturism}
\begin{exercise}
	Three Paragraphs. Analyze the representation of Afrofuturism in \textit{Neptune Frost}, examining how the film employs Afrofuturist aesthetics to critique traditional narratives around technology, identity, and globalization. In the first paragraph, discuss how the setting and visual style of the film contribute to its Afrofuturist themes, particularly through its portrayal of a futuristic yet distinctly African society. In the second paragraph, explore the characters' interactions with technology and how these interactions redefine conventional views on technology's role in societal development and cultural expression. In the third paragraph, consider the film's narrative structure and use of music, examining how these elements enhance the themes of resistance and reclamation of identity, and what this suggests about the potential of Afrofuturism to influence global discussions on race and technology.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Neptune Frost} vividly embodies Afrofuturist aesthetics through its unique setting and visual style, which merge elements of traditional African culture with futuristic, technological motifs. The film's environment is a collage of electronic waste and vibrant landscapes, symbolizing both the exploitation and the resilience of African lands and peoples. This setting serves not only as a backdrop but as a character in itself, reflecting the complex interplay between indigenous cultures and global technological advances. The use of vibrant colors, handmade costumes from recycled materials, and unconventional makeup all contribute to a visual narrative that challenges Western perceptions of African societies as either stuck in the past or catching up to a Western future. Instead, \textit{Neptune Frost} reimagines a future where African cultural identity and technological innovation are intertwined and leading the way forward.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	The characters in \textit{Neptune Frost} interact with technology in ways that defy traditional sci-fi tropes of technology as a force of Western modernization or alienation. Instead, technology is portrayed as a tool for liberation and artistic expression. The protagonists, an intersex runaway and a coltan miner, represent the intersection of gender, labor, and technology, challenging the exploitation inherent in global supply chains that often ignore the human cost of technological advancement. Their journey towards resistance against oppressive systems is facilitated by technological knowledge and hacker skills, which they use to disrupt the status quo. This redefinition of technology's role highlights its potential as a means of empowerment and cultural preservation, rather than mere economic development or Westernization.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
	Narratively and musically, \textit{Neptune Frost} disrupts conventional storytelling by integrating nonlinear plot developments and a chorus-like commentary that resonates with traditional African storytelling and musical forms. The music, blending traditional African rhythms with electronic music, acts as both a narrative device and a thematic layer, emphasizing themes of connectivity, community, and resistance. The use of music and poetic dialogue throughout the film not only advances the plot but also deepens the engagement with Afrofuturist themes, suggesting that the future of technology and innovation can be distinctly African and inherently revolutionary. The film's narrative structure and musical integration serve to challenge global narratives about race and technology, positing Afrofuturism as a radical reimagination of the future where African voices and visions lead the discourse.
}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Citationalism}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze the concept of "Citationalism" in \textit{Blade Runner}. Discuss how the film employs elements from both film noir and science fiction genres to create a hybrid aesthetic that references and recontextualizes classic cinematic tropes. Focus on how these citational elements contribute to the film's thematic depth and narrative complexity.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} exemplifies citationalism through its intertextual references to film noir and classic science fiction, creating a richly layered visual and thematic tapestry. The film noir influence is evident in its use of shadowy, rain-soaked urban settings, a morally ambiguous protagonist, and a pervasive sense of fatalism. These elements are seamlessly integrated with futuristic motifs such as neon-lit cityscapes and advanced technology, recontextualizing these noir components within a dystopian future. This blending serves to enhance the film’s narrative complexity, as it not only pays homage to these genres but also uses them to explore deeper themes of identity, memory, and humanity. The citational nature of \textit{Blade Runner} allows it to comment on the genre's conventions themselves, inviting viewers to question the boundaries between the human and the artificial, a central concern of both film noir’s existential inquiries and science fiction’s speculative gaze.
}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Graphic match}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze the significance of the graphic match, specifically the famous match cut from the bone to the spaceship in \textit{2001: A Space Odyssey}. Discuss how this use of editing contributes to the thematic depth of the film and how it encapsulates broader themes explored within the narrative.

\textcolor{blue}{
	The iconic match cut in \textbf{2001: A Space Odyssey}, where a bone thrown into the air by an early hominid transitions into a spaceship, is one of the most celebrated examples of graphic match in film history. This editing technique not only showcases Kubrick’s mastery in visual storytelling but also encapsulates the film's exploration of human evolution and technological progression. The cut brilliantly bridges millions of years of human history, linking the primitive use of tools to the heights of technological advancement, suggesting both a continuity and a transformation in human capabilities. This single, seamless transition highlights the thematic emphasis on the evolution of intelligence and technology's role in shaping human destiny. By juxtaposing these two objects, Kubrick visually implies that humanity’s inherent drive to develop tools, whether a bone or a spacecraft, is both an expression of human ingenuity and a potentially perilous power. The graphic match thus not only serves as a narrative pivot point but also invites the audience to reflect on the broader implications of technology and progress within the human experience, making it a critical moment that resonates throughout the film’s exploration of space and time.
}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Discontinuous editing}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the significance of "discontinuous editing" in \textit{La Jetée}. Analyze how the film's use of still images instead of continuous motion contributes to its narrative and emotional impact, particularly in conveying themes of memory and time.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{La Jetée} uniquely employs discontinuous editing through its almost exclusive use of still photographs to tell a story that deeply explores memory, time, and the human condition. This method of storytelling is particularly effective in reinforcing the film's themes, as the narrative revolves around the protagonist's journey through time, anchored by his haunting memories of a pre-war event. The use of static images mimics the way memories are often recalled in fragments—clear but static snapshots of moments, rather than a fluid, moving sequence. This technique also creates a sense of dislocation and alienation, mirroring the protagonist's emotional state and the dystopian world he navigates. Furthermore, the sparse movement within the film—primarily through the panning across and zooming in on photographs—heightens the dramatic impact of each frame, focusing the viewer's attention on specific details and amplifying the overall sense of suspense and foreboding. The discontinuous nature of the editing in \textit{La Jetée} thus not only challenges traditional cinematic forms but also enhances the narrative's exploration of temporal and psychological themes, making the film a profound meditation on the nature of time and memory.
}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Metacinematic expressions}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the metacinematic expressions in \textit{Blade Runner} and how the film uses these techniques to reflect on its own creation and the nature of cinema itself. Analyze specific scenes where the film acknowledges its status as a film or uses elements that draw attention to the filmmaking process.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} employs metacinematic expressions to enhance its narrative and engage the audience in a reflection on the nature of reality and filmmaking. One prominent example is the use of the Voight-Kampff test, a device used within the film to distinguish humans from replicants. This test, focusing on eye movements and emotional responses to questions, subtly mirrors the audience's experience in the cinema, as viewers gauge the emotions and authenticity of characters on screen. Additionally, the film's frequent use of reflections and transparent surfaces serves to blur the lines between the observed and the observer, drawing attention to the act of watching and being watched, both key themes in cinema. These techniques not only deepen the narrative's exploration of authenticity and perception but also invite viewers to consider the construction of reality in film, mirroring the replicants' quest for identity with the audience's engagement with the film as a constructed reality.
}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Disasters}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the significance of disaster in science fiction films, using \textit{Godzilla} as an example. Analyze how the film utilizes the disaster motif to explore broader themes such as human vulnerability, societal response to crises, and the consequences of technological or environmental mishaps.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Godzilla} epitomizes the significance of disaster in science fiction, serving as a metaphor for the destructive consequences of nuclear technology and its uncontrollable repercussions on humanity and nature. The film portrays Godzilla, a gigantic prehistoric creature awakened and mutated by nuclear testing, as a force of nature that brings about widespread destruction and chaos. This disaster motif is not merely a backdrop for action but a critical commentary on post-war Japanese society's anxieties and fears about nuclear power and its potential for catastrophic outcomes. Through scenes of Godzilla rampaging through Tokyo, the film visualizes the immense scale of destruction that nuclear technology can unleash, effectively transforming urban landscapes into scenes of apocalyptic ruin. These visual representations of disaster raise questions about human responsibility and the ethical implications of scientific advancement, while also highlighting the resilience and solidarity of the Japanese people in the face of such overwhelming adversity. The use of disaster in \textit{Godzilla} thus reflects broader societal concerns and serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of tampering with nature's balance.

\subsection{German Expressionalism}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss how German Expressionism influences the visual style and thematic depth of \textit{Metropolis}. Analyze how the film uses this style to enhance its narrative on social disparity and technological dystopia.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Metropolis}, directed by Fritz Lang, is a seminal example of German Expressionism, a style known for its use of distorted and exaggerated visual elements to evoke emotional responses. The film employs stark, contrasting lighting and elaborate, often grotesque set designs that create a foreboding, oppressive atmosphere, mirroring the film’s critique of industrialization and class struggle. These expressionist elements are most evident in scenes depicting the massive, mechanized factory settings and the catacombs where the workers live, which are designed to reflect the dehumanizing and alienating effects of the city’s capitalist society. The towering skyscrapers and the iconic scene of the enormous clock to which the protagonist is chained emphasize the crushing control of technology over human life. This visual style not only heightens the dramatic tension but also visually encapsulates the film's themes of power, control, and alienation, making a poignant commentary on the socio-economic issues of the Weimar Republic and predicting the unsettling potential futures of technological societies.

\subsection{Time machines}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze how the concept of time machines is utilized in \textit{La Jetée} to explore memory and trauma. Discuss how the film's unique structure of discontinuous still images enhances the theme of time travel and its impact on the protagonist's psychological journey.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{La Jetée} uses the concept of a time machine not merely as a sci-fi gadget but as a profound exploration of memory and trauma. The protagonist is sent back and forth in time, attempting to reconstruct his past and alter his future. The film's narrative is uniquely told through a series of still black-and-white photographs, which itself mirrors the fragmented and discontinuous nature of memory. This technique emphasizes the disjointed experience of time travel, where each image represents a moment captured and isolated from time, much like memories themselves. The sparse, carefully chosen visuals combined with the haunting voice-over narration create a sense of displacement and disorientation, enhancing the emotional impact of the time travel on the protagonist's life. The use of still images to depict the story of time travel in \textit{La Jetée} underlines the surreal and often disturbing nature of delving into and manipulating one’s memories, highlighting the overarching theme of the human psyche grappling with its past and its fate.

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Fascist Automation}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss how the theme of the "Fascist Automaton" is portrayed in \textit{Metropolis}, specifically focusing on how the robot Maria serves as a symbol of technological control and manipulation.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Metropolis} features the robot Maria as the quintessential "Fascist Automaton," representing a tool of authoritarian control and social manipulation. Created by the scientist Rotwang and used by the master of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen, the robot Maria is designed to mimic the human Maria, a figure of hope and rebellion among the workers. The robot's purpose is to discredit the real Maria and to incite chaos among the working class, thereby justifying harsher crackdowns on dissent. Visually, the transformation of Maria into her mechanical double is depicted through a surreal and visually striking sequence that highlights the fusion of technology and deceit. This automaton, with its perfect, unyielding features and its ability to manipulate masses, symbolizes the potential for technology under fascist control to enforce conformity and suppress individuality, serving as a stark warning of the dangers of allowing technology to be wielded as a tool of political power.
}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Hyperreality}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the concept of "Hyperreality" in \textit{Blade Runner}, analyzing how the film employs visual and narrative techniques to create a world where the real and the artificial are indistinguishable. Focus on how the setting, special effects, and character interactions contribute to this theme, reflecting on the implications for the viewer's perception of reality.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} masterfully explores the concept of hyperreality, presenting a future where the line between the real and the artificial becomes increasingly blurred. The film achieves this through its dense, neon-lit urban landscape, filled with towering skyscrapers and perpetual rain, which creates a visually immersive world that feels both familiar and unsettlingly alien. The special effects, particularly the realistic portrayal of the replicants, who are virtually indistinguishable from humans, further enhance the sense of hyperreality. Characters like Rachael challenge the protagonist’s and the audience's perceptions of what is real, as she herself is unaware of her synthetic nature until well into the narrative. This ambiguity is echoed in the film's use of reflective surfaces and shadows, which distort and obscure reality, making it difficult for characters and viewers alike to discern truth from simulation. By intertwining human and replicant interactions within this meticulously crafted environment, \textit{Blade Runner} not only questions the essence of human identity but also reflects on the impact of living in a world where reality is a construct, potentially altering our understanding and interaction with our own world.
}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Andrei Tarkovsky}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss Andrei Tarkovsky's ideas about science fiction and how they manifest in his film \textit{Solaris}. Analyze how Tarkovsky uses the science fiction genre to explore themes beyond technological speculation, focusing on the human condition and philosophical questions. Use specific examples from the film to illustrate how these themes are integrated into the narrative and visual style.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	Andrei Tarkovsky’s \textbf{Solaris} serves as a profound meditation on the human condition, reflecting his unique perspective on science fiction. Unlike typical genre films that emphasize futuristic technology and external conflict, Tarkovsky uses the science fiction setting of \textit{Solaris} to delve into internal, existential dilemmas. The film centers around psychologist Kris Kelvin’s emotional and psychological struggles as he interacts with a mysterious alien intelligence that materializes human thoughts and memories. Tarkovsky employs a slow, contemplative pacing and a focus on long, introspective takes that emphasize the emotional states of his characters, rather than the mechanics of the space station or the scientific specifics of the alien world. This approach highlights his belief that science fiction should not just speculate about technology, but also explore deeper philosophical questions about humanity’s place in the universe, memory, and identity. The hauntingly beautiful and often disorienting imagery of the oceanic planet Solaris serves as a visual metaphor for the characters’ subconscious, further aligning the film with Tarkovsky’s idea that science fiction is a tool to explore the metaphysical realms of human experience.
}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Solaris vs. 2001}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the significance of \textit{2001: A Space Odyssey} to \textit{Solaris}, focusing on how each film approaches themes of human consciousness and alien intelligence. Analyze how the two films use cinematic techniques to explore these themes, particularly in how they present human interactions with incomprehensible alien entities.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	Both \textit{2001: A Space Odyssey} and \textit{Solaris} delve deeply into the complexities of human consciousness in the face of alien intelligence, using a variety of cinematic techniques to explore these profound themes. In \textit{2001}, the interaction with the monolith, an inscrutable alien artifact, catalyzes humanity's leap in evolution and prompts deep philosophical questions about the nature of intelligence and progress. The film employs a minimalist aesthetic with long, contemplative shots that emphasize the isolation and smallness of humanity in the vastness of space, underscoring the themes of existential uncertainty and the search for meaning beyond earthly existence. In contrast, \textit{Solaris} uses the oceanic alien intelligence to create physical manifestations of human memories and emotions, thus externalizing internal human conflicts and desires. This leads to a more introspective exploration of the characters’ psyches, facilitated by a slow-paced narrative and close-up shots that capture the emotional turmoil of the protagonists. The significant connection between the two films lies in their portrayal of human encounters with alien forces as a mirror reflecting our own fears, desires, and existential dilemmas, highlighting cinema’s ability to explore the outer limits of human experience and understanding.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Primal scene}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze the significance of the "primal scene" and the "final scene" in \textit{Blade Runner}, discussing how these scenes bookend the film and reflect on its central themes. Focus on how the narrative constructs these scenes to enhance the viewer's understanding of the film's exploration of identity and existential queries.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textbf{Blade Runner}, the "primal scene" can be identified as the moment when Rick Deckard first tests Rachael to determine if she is a replicant, which sets the stage for the film’s exploration of identity, consciousness, and authenticity. This scene is critical as it introduces the central conflict of the narrative: the tension between human and replicant, real and artificial. Rachael's slow realization of her own nature and Deckard's subsequent questioning of his own humanity are sparked in this moment, making it a foundational scene for the unfolding drama. The "final scene," where Deckard flees with Rachael, opting to love her regardless of her replicant nature, serves as a thematic culmination of the film's query into what it means to be human. The ambiguity of whether Deckard himself is a replicant adds layers to this final scene, emphasizing the film's message that identity and humanity cannot be neatly categorized. Together, these scenes encapsulate the film’s philosophical questions, framing the narrative within the context of existential uncertainty and challenging the audience’s perceptions of reality and self.
}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Social functions of genre}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the social functions of the science fiction genre as depicted in \textit{Blade Runner}. Analyze how the film uses its dystopian future setting to comment on contemporary social issues, specifically focusing on themes of urban decay, corporate power, and environmental degradation. Consider how these themes serve as a critique of early 1980s societal trends and what this suggests about the role of science fiction in offering warnings or insights about the future.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Blade Runner} exemplifies the social functions of the science fiction genre by using its dystopian future setting to mirror and critique contemporary societal concerns of the early 1980s, such as urban decay, corporate dominance, and environmental neglect. The film's portrayal of Los Angeles in 2019, with its towering skyscrapers shrouded in smog and perpetual rain, serves as a stark visual metaphor for the unchecked urban expansion and environmental degradation plaguing many modern cities. Additionally, the omnipresent influence of powerful corporations in the film reflects growing anxieties about the rise of corporate power and its impact on individual autonomy. By presenting a future where humans are secondary to corporate interests and environmental health has deteriorated, \textit{Blade Runner} uses the conventions of the science fiction genre to offer a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of current social trends, thereby fulfilling one of the genre's key functions: to serve as a reflective lens through which we can examine the trajectory of our societal choices and their possible futures.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Film as 24 fps, conventions}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze how \textit{La Jetée} uses its unique structure of discontinuous still images to challenge traditional film conventions, specifically focusing on the concept of film as 24 frames per second. Discuss how this choice impacts the storytelling, viewer engagement, and the thematic depth of the film.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{La Jetée} uniquely subverts the traditional cinematic format by predominantly using a series of still images instead of the conventional 24 frames per second film strip. This method challenges the viewer's expectation of motion in film, creating a reflective, almost meditative narrative pace that aligns closely with the film’s themes of memory and time. Each still frame is like a memory captured in time, emphasizing the protagonist's journey through his past and the fragmented nature of human recollection. This discontinuous presentation forces viewers to fill in the gaps between frames, engaging them in the story construction process more actively than traditional film might. The sparse movement, highlighted in the brief motion sequence, punctuates the narrative dramatically, making it a pivotal moment of emotional and psychological impact. By eschewing continuous motion, \textit{La Jetée} not only deepens the thematic exploration of time and memory but also redefines the viewer’s role in interpreting and internalizing the cinematic experience.
}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Sound montage}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the use of "Sound Montage" in \textit{THX 1138}, focusing on how the film employs sound to enhance its dystopian atmosphere and themes of control and surveillance. Analyze specific examples where the sound design contributes to the narrative and thematic depth of the film.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textbf{THX 1138}, the use of sound montage plays a critical role in creating the film's oppressive dystopian atmosphere. Director George Lucas strategically layers disparate sound elements to evoke a sense of disorientation and unease. For example, the constant, overlapping announcements and commands emitted through the ubiquitous public address system not only fill the soundscape with a cacophony of voices but also serve as a constant reminder of the totalitarian control exerted over individuals in this society. These sound bites, ranging from mundane instructions to more sinister messages about obedience and surveillance, are juxtaposed with the stark silence that often surrounds the protagonist, THX, in his more private moments. This contrast effectively highlights the intrusion of the state into personal space and the pervasive nature of surveillance. Furthermore, the mechanical noises and electronic beeps that permeate scenes in the workplace or during THX's escape underscore the dehumanization and regimentation of life in this future world, enhancing the film’s commentary on the dangers of unchecked technological and governmental control.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Body Horror}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss the theme of "Body Horror" in \textit{The Fly} by focusing on how the film uses makeup, special effects, and narrative techniques to explore themes of physical transformation and the horror associated with losing control over one's body. Analyze how these elements not only horrify the viewer but also provoke deeper reflections on the nature of humanity and personal identity.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{The Fly} is a seminal work in the body horror genre, effectively using gruesome makeup and special effects to explore the horrific consequences of a scientific experiment gone wrong. The protagonist, Seth Brundle's gradual transformation into a fly is depicted with excruciating detail, highlighting the loss of his humanity both physically and psychologically. The film uses progressive stages of makeup to depict Seth’s transformation, each stage more grotesque than the last, culminating in a complete loss of his human form. This visual portrayal is complemented by narrative techniques that focus on Seth’s initial fascination and subsequent horror at his changing body, which mirrors the audience's reaction. Through close-ups and the raw, visceral quality of the makeup and effects, the film intensifies the personal tragedy of Seth’s transformation, emphasizing themes of alienation and the loss of self. This use of body horror not only serves to shock and repel but also engages viewers in a deeper contemplation of the fragility of human life and the ethical limits of scientific exploration.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Characteristics of genre}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze how \textit{Neptune Frost} exemplifies or challenges the characteristics of the science fiction genre. Discuss specific elements within the film that align with or subvert traditional sci-fi conventions, particularly in terms of its narrative structure, thematic concerns, and visual style.

\textcolor{blue}{
	\textbf{Neptune Frost} challenges and expands the traditional characteristics of the science fiction genre through its unique narrative structure, thematic depth, and visual style. Typically, science fiction explores futuristic themes through advanced technology and often dystopian visions; however, \textit{Neptune Frost} integrates these elements with a strong emphasis on African cultural aesthetics and political issues. The film’s narrative diverges from conventional sci-fi by focusing on themes of exploitation, colonialism, and global inequality—issues deeply rooted in the historical and contemporary realities of many African countries. Visually, the film eschews the sleek, polished look of mainstream sci-fi for a more eclectic and handmade aesthetic, utilizing costumes and sets made from upcycled electronic waste. This not only provides a visual critique of electronic consumerism but also redefines what futuristic technology looks like. Thus, \textit{Neptune Frost} subverts standard sci-fi tropes by presenting a future that is distinctly African, deeply intertextual, and resonant with current socio-economic challenges, suggesting a new direction for the genre that is inclusive of diverse narratives and aesthetics.
}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Intersex}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Discuss how the representation of intersex characters in \textit{Neptune Frost} contributes to the film's narrative and themes. Analyze how the portrayal challenges traditional gender norms and expectations within cinematic storytelling.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textit{Neptune Frost}, the intersex protagonist significantly enhances the film’s narrative and thematic layers, challenging traditional gender norms and cinematic conventions. The film presents its intersex character not as a marginal or exotic figure but as a central, complex individual whose experiences and identity drive the plot forward. This portrayal disrupts typical gender binaries seen in most mainstream cinema, highlighting issues of gender fluidity and the social constructions of gender roles. Through this character, the film explores themes of identity, belonging, and resistance against oppressive societal structures. The intersex protagonist's journey towards self-discovery and rebellion against a tyrannical regime metaphorically parallels the struggles faced by those who transcend conventional gender identities, thereby broadening the discourse around gender and identity in science fiction and contributing to a more inclusive representation of diverse human experiences.
}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Film animation}
\begin{exercise}
	One Paragraph. Analyze how the use of animation and automation in \textit{WALL-E} reflects broader themes about humanity, technology, and environmental stewardship. Consider how these elements contribute to the storytelling and overall message of the film.
	
\textcolor{blue}{
	In \textit{WALL-E}, the use of animation and automation serves as a pivotal storytelling mechanism that underscores themes of humanity, technology, and environmental responsibility. The film employs advanced CGI to animate not only characters like WALL-E—a robot with human-like qualities—but also the desolate Earth and the futuristic spaceships. This animation allows for a vivid portrayal of a planet overrun by waste, directly reflecting the consequences of human consumerism and neglect. WALL-E's automated functions, designed for compacting trash but adapted through his curiosity and empathy, symbolize hope and the potential for redemption. By juxtaposing scenes of a highly automated, consumer-driven spaceship community with the solitary, waste-collecting robot on Earth, the film critiques modern society's dependence on technology and automation, emphasizing a need to reconnect with more sustainable, environmentally aware practices. Thus, the animation and automation in \textit{WALL-E} highlight the ironies and challenges of our technological advancements, suggesting that humanity's survival depends not on further automation but on ecological and personal mindfulness.

    \end{itemize}
    \begin{proposition}
        $$E_n=-2.178\cdot10^{-18}\frac{Z^2}{n^2}$$
        $$\frac{1}{\lambda}=R\left(\frac{1}{m^2}-\frac{1}{n^2}\right)\text{, where

    Bohn then sets the simple condition of quantized angular momentum:
    \[
    I=m_evr=\frac{nh}{2\pi},\text{ where }n\in \mathbb{Z}
    \]
    which correspond precisely to the proposition. He also proposed that electrons are most likely to be found at 
    \begin{proposition}
        $$r=n^2a_B$$
    \end{proposition}
    where $a_B$ is the Bohr radius. This reminds us of standing waves and hence de Broglie proposed the matter-wave relationship:
    \begin{theorem}[de Broglie Relationship]
        $$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$
    \end{theorem}
\end{descriptions}

\section{The Schrodinger Equation}
We wish to expand upon the already known one-dimensional schrodinger equation by paramaterizing $\psi$ as $\psi(\mathbf{r})=\psi(x,y,z)$ and similarly for $U(\mathbf{r})$:
\begin{theorem}[One-dimensional Schrodinger Equation]
    $$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=\frac{2M}{\hslash}(U-E)\psi$$
\end{theorem}
In three dimensions, the equation generalizes to:
\begin{theorem}[Three-dimensional Schrodinger Equation]
    $$-\frac{\hslash^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + U(\mathbf{r}) \psi = E \psi$$
    or
    $$\nabla^2\psi=\frac{2M}{\hslash^2}(U_E)\psi$$
\end{theorem}
Separating the wave function using time and position dependence, we simplify the above to the time-independent schrodinger equation:
\begin{theorem}[Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation]
    $$\nabla^2=\frac{2M(U(\mathbf{r})-E)}{\hslash}\psi$$
\end{theorem}
We will see that in the absence of forces, $U(\mathbf{r})=0$, the solution to the function will be:
$$\psi(\mathbf{r})=\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})$$
whose vector $\mathbf{k}$ satisfies the energy equation: 
$$E=\frac{\hslash|\mathbf{k}|^2}{2M}$$
\section{The Rectangular Box}
While subjected to a potential energy function of a 2-D rectangular square well, the wave function must satisfy:
$$\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y)}{\partial y^2}=-\frac{2ME}{\hslash}\psi(x,y)$$
and this is because the $U$ term is zero and we have:
\begin{proposition}
    \[
    U(x,y)=\begin{cases}
        0,\;0\leq x\leq a,\;0\leq y\leq b\\
        \infty,\;\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{proposition}
To solve the rectangular box problem, we will use the method of \textbf{seperation of variables}, that is:
$$\psi(x,y)=\mathscr{X}(x)\mathscr{Y}(y)$$
and we can solve the equation as:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y)}{\partial y^2}&=-\frac{2ME}{\hslash}\psi(x,y)\\
    \frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\mathscr{Y}(y)\right)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\mathscr{Y}(y)\right)}{\partial y^2}&=-\frac{2ME}{\hslash}\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\mathscr{Y}(y)\right)\\
    \frac{1}{\mathscr{X}(x)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\right)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{1}{\mathscr{Y}(y)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{Y}(y)\right)}{\partial y^2}&=-\frac{2ME}{\hslash}\\
    \frac{1}{\mathscr{X}(x)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\right)}{\partial x^2}&=-\left(\frac{2ME}{\hslash}+\frac{1}{\mathscr{Y}(y)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{Y}(y)\right)}{\partial y^2}\right)\\
    \text{Since RHS has no $x$ dependence, }\frac{1}{\mathscr{X}(x)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\right)}{\partial x^2}&=-k_x^2\text{ where $k_x$ is arbitrary}\\
    \implies\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\right)}{\partial x^2}&=-k_x^2\mathscr{X}(x)
\end{align*}
This equation is similar to the 1-D rigid box example. In the 1-D case, the solution is given by 
$$A\sin k_xx+B\cos k_xx$$ 
We know that the boundaries are $x=0,x=a,y=-,y=b$ and hence $\mathscr{X}(0)=0$ and hence we can omit the cosine term in the solution. Likewise, applying the second boundary condition $\mathscr{X}(a)=0$, like in the 1-D example, we also have 
$$k_x=\frac{n_x\pi}{a}x$$ 
We can do precisely the same in the y-dependent domain, and hence we know the solution to the equation has to be:
\begin{proposition}
    $$\psi(x,y)=C\sin \frac{n_x\pi}{a}x\sin\frac{n_y\pi}{a}y$$ where $C=AB$.
\end{proposition}
Nevertheless, since
$$\frac{1}{\mathscr{X}(x)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{X}(x)\right)}{\partial x^2}=-k_x^2,\;\frac{1}{\mathscr{Y}(y)}\frac{\partial^2\left(\mathscr{Y}(y)\right)}{\partial y^2}=-k_y^2$$
we will see that
$$k_x^2+k_y^2=\frac{2ME}{\hslash^2}$$
For which once we solve it, we will arrive at the allowed energies for a particle in a 2-D rectangular box:
$$E=\frac{\hslash^2\pi^2}{2M}\left(\frac{n_x^2}{a^2}+\frac{n_y^2}{b^2}\right)$$
Note that the same can generalize into three dimensions, where we have the time-independent schrodinger equation:
$$\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y,z)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y,z)}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,y,z)}{\partial z^2}=-\frac{2ME}{\hslash}\psi(x,y,z)$$
and we set $\psi(x,y,z)=\mathscr{X}(x)\mathscr{Y}(y)\mathscr{Z}(Z)$ to get:
$$E=\frac{\hslash^2\pi^2}{2M}\left(\frac{n_x^2}{a^2}+\frac{n_y^2}{b^2}+\frac{n_z^2}{c^2}\right)$$
\subsection{Degeneracy}
We see that there may be multiple ways of choosing $n_x$ and $n_y$ to get the identical energy value. 
\begin{definition}[Degeneracy]
    Degeneracy refers to a situation where two or more distinct quantum states correspond to the same energy level in a system.
\end{definition}
For instance, for a rectangular box with widths $a$ and $\frac{a}{2}$:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\hline\hline
State & $n_x$ & $n_y$ & $E$ & Degeneracy\\
\hline\hline
Ground & 1 & 1 & $5E_0$ & 1 \\
First excited & 2 & 1 & $8E_0$ & 1 \\
Second excited & 3 & 1 & $13E_0$ & 1 \\
Third excited & 1 & 2 & $17E_0$ & 1 \\
Fourth excited & 2,4 & 2,1 & $20E_0$ & 2 \\
Fifth excited & 3 & 2 & $25E_0$ & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{The Central Force Problem}
\begin{theorem}[The Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation in Spherical Coordinates]
    $$\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{d\psi}{dr}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{d\psi}{d\theta}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin^2\theta}\frac{d^2\psi}{d\phi^2}=\frac{2M}{\hslash}(U-E)\psi$$
\end{theorem}
Using separation of variables, we can separate this into three different second order equations. We start with:
\begin{align*}
&\frac{r\sin^2\theta}{\mathcal{R}}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}(r\mathcal{R}) + \frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bigg(\sin\theta\frac{\partial\Theta}{\partial\theta}\bigg)+\frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2} = \frac{2M(U-E)}{\hslash^2}(r^2\sin^2\theta)\\
&\frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2} = \frac{2M(U-E)}{\hslash^2}(r^2\sin^2\theta)-\frac{r\sin^2\theta}{\mathcal{R}}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}(r\mathcal{R})-\frac{\sin\theta}{\Theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bigg(\sin\theta\frac{\partial\Theta}{\partial\theta}\bigg)
\end{align*}

And we can observe that 
$$\frac{\Phi''}{\Phi} = \text{function of $r$ and $\theta$}.$$

\textbf{Boundary conditions for Hydrogen energy level quantization: }radial probability distribution goes to 0 as $r\rightarrow\infty$

\textbf{Spherical symmetry: }only $s$ orbitals are spherically symmetric

\textbf{Degeneracy of Hydrogen atom: }$n^2$. However, this degeneracy is broken in multielectron atoms due to the introduction of electron shielding and correlation energies

\textbf{Degeneracy of orbitals: }total number of electrons halved: i.e. for $2s,2p$, degeneracy is 4

\textbf{Probability: }$P(r)=4\pi r^2|R(r)|^2$

\textbf{Probability of finding electron: }$\iiint4\pi r^2|R(r)|^2dV$

\textbf{Binding energy: }same as electron dissociation energy, positive

\textbf{Concept of effective nuclear charge: }it is influenced by electron screening and electron correlation energies. For Hydrogen, the effective charge is 1 due to the lackthereof of screening effects. If we add another electron filling the first shell, the effective charge of all electrons is still close to 1, though a bit less due to electron correlation. However, if we add a $2p$ electron, due to the screening of the first shell, its effective charge would be quite a bit more less than 1. But then again, if we give it a full second shell, i.e. full occupancy of $2s,2p$ orbitals, while experiencing screening from the $1s$ shell, due to the full shell, the effective charges would be much closer to 1 than for an incomplete shell, though not exactly 1.

\textbf{Coulombic interactions: }for $\rm H_2^+$: apart from the obvious Coulomb forces present, we need to consider the respective wave functions for the electrons. We can use the LCAO-MO approach. For constructive interference, the wave functions would look something like: 
\[\psi_+=A(\psi_{\rm 1,1s}+\psi_{\rm 2,1s})\]
and for destructive interference:
\[\psi_+=B(\psi_{\rm 1,1s}-\psi_{\rm 2,1s})\]
where $\psi_1,\psi_2$ are $1s$ radial function solutions to the Hydrogen atom corresponding to protons 1 and 2. In bonding ($\psi_+$), we see an increase in electron density near the space between the nuclei. For antibonding ($\psi_-$), we have close to 0 probability density between the nuclei. The graphs of the wave functions look something like:
\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}
Now for the Coulombic potentials in the Stroedinger equation, we have:
$$U=\frac{-e^2\textbf{r}_1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}+U=\frac{-e^2\textbf{r}_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}+U=\frac{e^2\textbf{r}_P}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$
where we have one term for each e-p attraction, and one term for the p-p repulsion. As per the formation energies, the plot looks something like:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Pictures/e.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{

\end{figure}
The minimum, $R_0$, is the bond length. It is the point of zero force, where the p-p repulsive force equals the e-p attractive force. The interaction leas to a stable potential minimum in  proton seperation. The driving force for bond formation is the build up of electron density, where a larger net attractive force, $Z_{\rm eff}$. As for antibonding, the opposing trend is the destructive interference of e-p attraction leading to increased repulsive force between nuclei. Electron repulsion leads to depletion of electron density between protons: they take work to create the same electron distribution around the individual protons and as such, they have a higher energy.

Now if we add one more electron to make hydrogen gas, things get more complicated: we also need to consider the e-e repulsion. This renders the problem unsolvable, as there is no way for us to solve for the wave function using separation of variables. However, there are two methods that still hold up:

\textbf{Independent particle approximation: }We would use the wave function solutions that assumes only one electron to create an assumed solution that is expected to be the dominant term. Then, we use that distribution to create a spatially varying potential. That potential would then lead to a modified wave function, which can be used to redefine the potential. We can repeat the process for each trial function, recursively subbing potentials into wave functions to calculate for energy. Eventually, the approximate solution should converge.

\textbf{Variation method: }Uses trial functions in which a key parameter is used as a variable parameter. For instance, for Helium, the effective nuclear charge due to electron correlation is a variable parameter. We then plug it into the Schroedinger equation and write energy as a function of the variation parameter. Then, we take the derivative and find the minimum of energy, where that solution is the best solution within the approximation yielding correlations to energies, effective nuclear charge and radial distributions.

\begin{theorem}[Bond Order]
	$${\rm BO}=\frac{\rm bonding-antibonding electrons}{\rm 2\cdot number of atoms}$$
	For higher bond orders, the bond distance is smaller and the bond energy is lower, resulting in a stronger, more stable bond. Not the differences between antibonding and nonbonding orbitals. When drawing bonding and antibonding, make sure that the positive cloud lines up with negative cloud for constructive interference, and the opposite for destructive, where there is a depletion of electron density in the center.
\end{theorem}

moving across the periodic table, we have more and more added electrons and their respective protons to create larger effective nuclear charges while each added electron does not screen its complementary proton (electron correlation energies). This increase in effective charge results in tighter binding of electrons, reduced radii. To explain mathematically, the $l$ dependence of the radial distributions for which there are larger probabilities for being closer to the nucleus will be lower in energy and higher ionization energies.

\textbf{Valence electron shell pair repulsion: }For water, the bond angle is less than 109.5$^\circ$, and this is because the bond is compressed by the electron density created by the lone pairs, where a larger effective repulsive volume is created for electrons in these nonbonding orbitals. This non-uniform force in $sp^2$ hybridization results in the minimum energy.

\textbf{Dipole moments: }Looking at water again, due to the excess electronegativity  of Oxygen, volumes near it has a net negative charge buildup, giving the Hydrogens net positive characters due to charge conservation. This creates a dipole moment.

\textbf{Atoms that has abnormal electron configuration: }i.e. $\rm 5s^14d^{10}$. The cost of pairing electrons to create a filled shell is less than the cost to promote to a higher valence shell. This is because the Zeeman effect, where the additional magnetic field interaction ensures the electrons do not occupy the same space at the same time, offsets the costs to pair two electrons. 

Now we move the discussion onto intermolecular forces, rather than intramolecular.

\textbf{H-Bond forces: }the electrostatic attraction between Hydrogen and more electronegative atoms, where Hydrogen always takes on a positive character. There is some degree of electron sharing between Hydrogen and other elements in the prosess that goes beyond an electrostatic or dipole-dipole bond. Only O, N, F are considered H-bond formers.

\textbf{Dipole-dipole forces: }Coulombic attractive forces between partial charges

\textbf{Van der Wall forces: }arice from instantaneous fluctuations in electron density that create temporary dipole moments. This instantaneous dipole moment then induces a dipole in a neighbouring atom, leading to electrostatic attraction. The net attractive force $\propto 1/r^6$.

\textbf{Ionic bonds: }when electron is completely localized on the more electronegative atom in a bonded pair of atoms, leaving a positive charge on one atom and a negative charge on another.

Now we move onto IR/vibrational spectroscopy. Electronic energy, with a particle in a box model is energy stored as potential energy in excited electronic configurations. Vibrational energy in the harmonic oscillator model is the oscillatory motion of atoms or groups of atoms with a molecule, where kinetic and potential energies are being exchanged.

There are two categories of spectroscopy:
\begin{itemize}\item \textbf{Absorption}
\item \textbf{Emission}\begin{itemize}\item fluorescence
\item phosphorescence \end{itemize} \end{itemize}


\textbf{Selection rules: } Spin: $\Delta S=0$, there must be no change in electron spin. Symmetry: the transition between two electronic or vibrational states must involve a change in symmetry. This ensures that there is a net dipole moment that allows the electric field to transfer energy. Either a bond dipole (vibrations) or transition dipole moment (electronic transitions) are involved in enabling coupling of the electric field to the atomic vibrational motions. Mathematically, the $\mu$ is an odd function and for the integral $\int\psi_n\psi_m\mu d\tau$ to be nonvanishing, the argument inside the integral must be even and hence the wave functions must be odd.

\begin{theorem}[Vibrational Modes]
	For bent molecules:
	$$V=3N-6$$
	For linear molecules:
	$$V=3N-5$$
	Generally, there are three distinct modes of vibrations: 
	\begin{itemize}\item asymmetric stretch
	\item symmetric stretch
	\item bend \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

In infrared spectroscopy we create the model as a vibrating molecule that behaves like two masses joined by a spring. To determine the IR activity of each vibrational mode, we examine whether the vibrational forces on each atom can be cancelled out or not. However, if a molecule has no net dipole moment, no modes are active. Going over the effect of increasing the mass of atoms while maintaining the charges, the absorption wavelength would be longer due to the larger mass lowering frequency. The quantum harmonics' energies and their probability distributions follow:

Now we translate to discussion on fluorescence and phosphorescence. In general, fluorescence has much shorter lifetimes, and fluorescence is decay from an excited singlet state (spin conserved transition) to ground singlet state, whereas phosphorescence is decay from an excited triplet state to singlet ground state. This transition is formally forbidden and only occurs weakly due to fluctuation in instantaneous electron distributions that produce fluctuating
magnetic fields that can couple to the spin to from the singlet state. This is far less probable than
a spin allowed transition and accounts for the much longer decay time for phosphorescence. 

For more information on singlet and triplet states, a singlet state is in which pairs of electrons have opposing state, and a triplet state is in which pairs of electrons have the same spin. While transition between the two states are forbidden, singlet states can be converted to lower energy triplet states by intersystem crossing (ISC). 

Moreover, the \textbf{Frank-Codon} principle states that when a molecule is undergoing electronic transitions, the nuclear configuration experiences no significant change because nuclei are much bigger than electrons and electronic transition takes place faster than the nuclei can respond. When the nucleus realigns itself with the new electronic configuration, the theory states that it must undergo a vibration.

In summary, there are three possible transitions for excited molecules:
\begin{itemize}
	
\item \textbf{Radiative:} photon is absorbed or emitted, we draw this as solid lines
\item \textbf{Non-radiative: }energy is transferred between different degrees of freedom of a molecule or to the surroundings, we draw this with wavy vertical lines
\item \textbf{ISC: }transitions between singlet and triplet state, we draw this with dotted lines

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Absorption and emission of light: }
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Pictures/p.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The wavy lines represent vibrational relaxation from higher to lower vibrational levels for energy conservation. For fluorescent, spin is allowed; for phosphorescent, spin is forbidden and the process is slower. \textbf{Kasha's rule: }all emission occurs from lowest $v=0$ level of fluorescent to phosphorescent. Due to phosphorescent forbidding spin, $T_1$ is lower energy than $S_1$. This is because Hund's rule (Electrons occupy orbitals in a way that maximizes the total spin quantum number (s) for the electrons in the subshell) only applies to degenerate electronics levels, favoring the allowance of spin in fluorescent.

This very same mechanism of vibrational relaxation is the reason why absorbance of a sample at any wavelength remains unchanged with time. Theoretically, it would seem that all molecules in a sample would have been excited and no more absorption would occur given enough time radiating. Under conditions of constant radiation, a steady state is reached and the absorbance of the sample remains unchanged in time. If the incident radiation is of sufficient intensity so that the rate of excitation is faster than relaxation processes, the sample convergence onto a state where half of the molecules are excited, half not, where the rate of absorption is equal to the rate of emission.

Often, we find our probability for electronic transitions are not accurate. This is because of the Franck Condon principle that was introduced earlier. To account for nuclei overlap, we add a \textbf{Franck Condon factor}, $\int\psi_m(\nu)\psi_n(\nu')d\nu$ in addition to the $\int\psi_n\psi_m\mu d\tau$ for transition probability such that the original term determines if a transition will happen at all, and the newly added Franck Condon term will determine the level of overlap between the original state and the transitioned state, effectively dictating intensity.

When we apply absorbance principles to different molecules, we need to examine both the $pi$ electron delocalization as well as the geometry. Consider a longer molecule vs a short one. In the longer one, due to the increased length, the spacing between energy levels is less, causing the absorption wavelength to be larger.

Another example is nonpolar organic molecules. Due to the bonding orbitals being filled, the only transition gap is from the bonding to antibonding orbitals, which translates to a huge energy gap and short absorption wavelengths. Conversely, in the ion radicals, since either there is space in bonding orbitals or bonding orbitals have been overfilled into the nonboding orbitals, the transitions are either from bonding to bonding or from nonbonding to nonbonding, hence the energy gap is lower and absorption wavelengths are larger.
